The decor is outdated, as more attention is paid to cleanliness and food quality than ambiance. For many years, the customers entered the restaurant through the kitchen so that they would be able to satisfy themselves about the restaurant’s cleanliness before they ate there. During World War II, MTR found it difficult to make idlis since rice was in short supply. According to MTR, they experimented with using semolina instead of rice and thus invented the very popular breakfast item of Rava idli.\n",

Vehicles r both off the road and on it, sunk into the many potholes that the gov insist to leave the way they r, may b like drishti chukke to shoo off bad spirits (except the gov itself). It brings traffic to a standstill (gives me and Sinchana enough time for each other), and pollution, let's not even start with that. But when i look at it, Bangalore has a huge heart, it welcomes all, embraces them and gives everyone a reason to stay back and love it (a sort of love-hate relationship though). For me, no matter how much I crib of its current sorry state or paint a picture to the immigrants abt it's heydays as a city to retire, at the end of the day, It's just home to me. Where I belong.

Ants soon got to him and some ants in fact crawled into his ear which somehow managed to go to his brain. When he woke up, he did not realize that ants had gone to his head. After that, he constantly complained about itchiness around his face. His mother brought him to a doctor, but the doctor could not figure out what was wrong with him. He took an X-ray of the boy and to his horror, he found a group of live ants in his skull. Since the ants were still alive, the doctor could not operate on him because the ants were constantly moving around. The boy finally died. So please be careful when leaving food stuff near your bed or when eating in bed. This might attract ants. Most importantly, NEVER you or your child eat sweets before going to bed.

She said a v important thing. “When you were all young, I had no time nor did I know what to teach you all. So I would sit with you all. But that worked well with you as you learnt to study on your own. I see parents who sit and teach 2 to 3 hours daily but the kids are not at all serious.”\n",

The loss is small. So what they get less marks in class 2 or 5 or 7! Let them realize what is failure early on. They will understand how to do self study. And trust me, in this age of internet, the only reason I am sending my kids to school is because I want them to mingle around with 20 other kids and teachers. Socialize with them . Of course I need peace too. ;).\n",

If they say it was tough, I know I need to explain it to them as they still have not understood the usage of what ever they learnt and hence it seemed tough to them. It also tells me that I did not explain to them good enough for their smarty heads. So I have to simplify the explanations.\n",

If you do it yourself, you will know how much you understood. If I do it then how will you practice. Do you want to keep on studying the same thing again after today and waste your time? Because if you don’t do your home work and project yourself, you will forget it after today. Then one more day you will have to sit to do it again afresh. That will reduce your playtime.” And I mean what I say.\n",

                        "1. There is nothing that threatens the security of a wife than the thought of another woman competing for the attention and affection of her husband. Nothing is more painful. Nothing is more disrespecting. Nothing is more insulting. Nothing is more belittling and degrading.\n",
                        "2. Marriage flourishes when the couple works together as a team; when both husband and wife decide that winning together is more important than keeping score.\n",
                        "Good marriages don't just happen. They are a product of hard work.\n",
                        "3. Your children are watching you and forming lasting opinions on love, commitment, and marriage based on what they see in you. Give them hope. Make them look forward to marriage.\n",
                        "4. Husbands: The reason why other women look attractive is because someone is taking good care of them. Grass is always green where it is watered. Instead of drooling over the green grass on the other side of the fence, work on yours and water it regularly. Any man can admire a beautiful woman, but it takes a true gentleman to make a woman admirable and beautiful.\n",
                        "5. When a husband puts his wife first above everyone and everything except God, it gives his wife the sense of security and honor that every wife hungers for.\n",
                        "6. A successful marriage doesn't require a big house, a prefect spouse, a million dollars or an expensive car. You can have all the above and still have a miserable marriage. A successful marriage requires honesty, undying commitment and selfless love and Jesus at the center of it all.\n",
                        "7. Pray for your spouse every day; in the morning, in the afternoon and at evening. Don’t wait until there is a problem. Don’t wait until there is an affair. Don’t wait until something bad happens. Don’t wait until your spouse is tempted. Shield your spouse with prayer and cover your marriage with the fence of prayer.\n",

                        "9. One spouse cannot build a marriage alone when the other spouse is committed to destroying it. Marriage works when both husband and wife work together as a team to build their marriage.\n",
                        "10. Don't take your spouse for granted. Don't take advantage of your spouse's meekness and goodness. Don't mistake your spouse's loyalty for desperation. Don't misuse or abuse yours spouse's trust. You may end up regretting after losing someone that meant so much to you.\n",
                        "11. Beware of marital advice from single people. Regardless of how sincere their advice may be, most of it is theoretical and not derived from real life experiences. If you really need Godly advice, seek it from God-fearing, impartial and prayerful mature couples whose resolve has been tested by time and shaped by trials.\n",
                        "12. Dear wife, Don't underestimate the power of the tongue on your marriage. The tongue has the power to crush your marriage or build it up. Don't let the Devil use your tongue to kill your spouse's image, self-confidence and aspirations. Let God use your tongue to build up your marriage and bless and praise your spouse.\n",

Autophagy means to \"self eat\". In other words, the process by which the human body eats it own damaged cells and unused proteins. Autophagy is a natural process and also one which occurs in cases of starvation. The failure of autophagy is one of the main reasons for accumulation of damaged cells which eventually leads to various diseases in the body. Autophagy is important to prevent/fight cancer and also plays a vital role in degrading and 'consuming' cells infected by bacteria and viruses.\n",

Many of us religiously follow this practice to this day as a penance for spiritual progress without any idea of the biological and therapeutic benefits of this practice. Through this process of fasting induced autophagy, our body repaired its damaged and degenerated cells or used up the proteins of the damaged cells for its survival.\n",

We can easily use cards, but for them, getting 100 rupees for few days is tough and will help them reinvest again in their business.

Whenever we use a debit card or credit card, do you know that there is a transaction fee associated with it? In most cases you may not be charged but the merchant will be charged. Let us understand what this is for. First of all, no banks or any entities provide any sought of financial networks. It’s all provided by international companies namely VISA, MasterCard, American Express etc. For example, when you get an ATM card with VISA label on that from the issuing bank, the bank provides you the facility to use the visa network. For that the bank has to pay a nominal fee to VISA for every transaction. The bank will get this back from the merchant. So each transaction makes these foreign companies rich.\n",
                        "Now let us see about the RuPay technology introduced by NPCI (National Payment Corporation of India) under the guidelines of RBI (Reserve Bank of India). RuPay is a similar network as VISA, MasterCard etc. This is managed by Reserve Bank of India. All most all public sector and private banks have started to give RuPay based cards to their customers. RuPay cards got a major boost through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as RuPay cards were issued to all Jan Dhan accounts.\n",
                        "The advantages are lot. The main advantage is the transaction charges. Charges are very minimal. While Visa / MasterCard / Amex cards creates a transaction fee of about 1.9% of the total amount, RuPay will charge only 0.01%. Secondly, these charges in turn go to the Reserve Bank Itself. Third and the most important - All the transactional data lies in the Indian Servers. The good news is that NPCI is trying to make it international, which means foreign banks will start using RuPay cards. You can get more information about RuPay from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPay\n",

While normal medical checks revealed nothing wrong in him, deeper probes revealed the reason – his stomach was collecting significant amounts of wax. And doctors identified the villian – the ordinary disposable paper cups he used for drinking his tea at his office pantry.Disposable paper cups have become quite popular in office pantries due to the convenience it offers. What many overlook is the fact that these paper cups are coated with a tiny layer of wax, which is essential to prevent water from seeping into the paper. When very hot liquids are pour over this cup, the paper cups wax may disintegrate and a little maycome off, which will promptly be sent along with the drink into our stomachs! While our body can discard minor amounts, over the long-term, it does become aproblem.So what can be done about it? You can try to bring your own glass cups. Glass is one of the least reactive materials in the world (remember acids are stored in glass vessels, blood samples are collected in glass plates – these are for a good reason). But glass does have the problem of breaking easily, so it requires good care. Ceramic cups are probably the best bet. Of course, you can also use your ordinary stainless steel glass, but never use plastic ones – they are harmful, and its dangers are even worse than wax.\n",

                        "\n",
                        "Recently I met a famous allopathy doctor on account of a medical article. He is in his 70s…is an ENT specialist. It was astonishing to listen to one of his experience which he shared. That day morning when he woke up he had a problem. He had an urge to pass urine but for some reason he was unable to do. At this age some people face with such problem some times and if they try two or three times they may succeed. He tried after some time but same condition. His continuous efforts didn’t bear any result. Then he realised there is some problem. Though he is a doctor but he is not an exception to such physical problems as he is also made of the same flesh and blood like everyone. Now his lower abdomen became heavy and he was unable to sit or stand and was suffering with the building pressure. Immediately he called up a known urologist on phone and explained his situation. Urologist replied “I am at present in a hospital in the outskirts and I will be coming to a clinic in your area in another one and a half hour. Will you be able to withstand that long?” He replied “I will try”. \n",
                        "At that instant he received an incoming call which happened to be from another allopathy doctor from his town (Suseendharam). With great difficulty the ENT doctor explained his situation to his childhood friend doctor.  His friend echoed back “oh, your urine bladder is full and you are unable to pass urine. Don’t worry, do as I suggest, you will be able to pass urine”. And he started giving the instructions. “Stand up and jump vigorously …while jumping lift both your hands as though you are plucking the mangoes. Do like this for 15 to 20 times”. What, when the bladder is full he wants me to jump? Though little sceptical the ENT doctor started trying it. What a relief within 5 to 6 time jumping urine started passing. ENT doctor felt overjoyed and felt thankful to his childhood friend doctor for solving it with such simple solution which otherwise would have required an admission in a hospital where they would have inserted a catheter inside the bladder, injections, anti-biotics etc resulting in a bill amount crossing Rs 50,000 in addition to physical and mental stress for him and his near and dear ones.\n",

Now if the government passes a resolution saying all these establishments have to sell a plate of idli sambar at ₹5 irrespective of the type of establishment, failing which action will be taken against the establishments. Add to that, if the idli sambar doesn’t taste good, and the customer is not satisfied, the person selling the idli sambar will be sent to jail and a fine ranging from 30,000 to a few lakhs. What will the establishments do?? Do you think a 5 star hotel will be able to sell idli sambar at ₹5?? They will eventually close down as they will not have revenue to run the place. \n",

He had paid for chocolates and a carton of cigarettes. The cashier put a packet of cigarettes extra into his bag and he thought it was a free pack.  He was arrested for shop-lifting and the Thai Police extortion price was 30,000 Baht for his release.   He spent two nights in jail and paid 500 Baht for an air-conditioned cell, 200-300 baht for each visitor and 11,000 baht for his final release.   The Police shared the money in front of his eyes. On top of that, he was charged in court and fined 2,000 baht by the magistrate and handcuffed and escorted to his plane.  His passport was stamped \"Thief\". While there, his relatives requested help from the Indian Embassy and were told that embassy is helpless. Many Asians are victimized similarly daily and letters and phone-calls to Thai authorities are ignored.   He shared a cell with a Singaporean the first night who paid 60,000 baht for his release. The second night was a Malaysian national who paid 70,000 baht. Mind you this was not in a shanty shop in downtown Bangkok but in a duty free shop at the Bangkok Int'l Airport . BE WARNED. The above is 100% correct information because Mr Rajan Khera's customer from India faced exactly the same scenario mentioned above when he was in transit at Bangkok Int'l Airport coming to Taipei. Someone who went through the same ordeal in Dubai . He bought stuff at the Duty Free upon entering. The girl at Duty Free put a bottle of cologne in his shopping bag (he did not even see it happen). He was arrested for stealing (this is before he even picked up his luggage). He sat at the airport jail where he was harassed for the whole day. NO FOOD, NO WATER for one day and only after he paid a fine (bribe of US 500...). That is all the cash he had in his pocket at the time. They let him go.!! These are scams happening all over the place. Please BE CAREFUL! All of this is pre-planned and the people who work at the airport know whom to target.

On this day there are certain important times when we should sit and meditate to achieve our goals. These times are the MITRA muhurat.

There are six specific times during the entire day when there is no pull from the moon and the earth is flooded with intense magnetic vibrations which have a powerful effect on the chakras of our body. During such times when we sit in meditation for two hours (basically long enough to have strong visualization) and focus on our unfilled desires and visualize them as fulfilled, then they are easily fulfilled. Our strong visualization vibrations move upwards and receive strength from the magnetic waves present in the atmosphere and they return back to us as the fulfillment of our goals.\n",

A month after the coronation, he made education and health services completely free for his subjects through out the kingdom. In Bhutan no one pays for education and health services. He increased the salaries of the teachers which is more than the bureaucrats. In front of teachers, he never sits on his throne, instead he sits on a normal chair. But he offers higher chair to teachers. In royal functions , there are always few Seats reserved for teachers. The teachers in Bhutan are required to pay the minimum tax.  The main purpose of displaying immense respect to teachers are to encourage better education system in the kingdom. Due to his consistent effort, after ten years, the education system of Bhutan is one of the best in the world. \n",

Each side tries to intimidate the other by marching faster, stomping more louder and raising their legs higher than the other through choreographed moves. It was a real treat to watch. Patriotism hits the peak, with goosebumps right from the start. Some of you might have witnessed this, and if you haven’t yet, then there is something to look forward to once in your life.\n",

And I’m sure this situation might not make a complete change to what we were or where we were headed to.  But I personally feel this sudden stop was like a detox session that was required at a global level, it did change our perspectives in many ways. For example in our Org we give 1 day a week work from home, and many a times noticed people seeing that as a rest day with low productivity. And other teams and companies fighting to get work from home as management thought it would be low productivity as well. Now that people have got used to this routine they are actually working more, their energies are more (considering how traffic can drain you out in Bangalore, 2-3 hrs on the road) and employees have started taking more ownership. So here is a new perspective to the traffic challenges and how companies thought we just could not run teams at home. In just 1 week of declaring WFH we’ve had every manager right from the CEO communicating on how to effectively WFH, how to keep the employees moral high and studying the psychological effects of working in isolation, and help boost it. Funny situation now is our teams are asking permission to work from office and we are restricting them. Basically we think we just cannot achieve something, but circumstances make us do it more efficiently than we were doing before. Effectively at the end of the day, our energies are still high. It’s been a long day and since the Last one and a half hour I’ve been in an escalation, and yet writing this looooooong message as I still have that energy left unlike another day, while eating jackfruits the min I shut my laptop 😃\n",

This kind of P/E typically signifies a country whose GDP is growing (or will grow in the future) at 10%+. (note India's GDP will be -5% to -10% in FY21)   Personally i think markets are way above where they should be. I think we may be looking at a crash.. Those who have a 5-10 year view may not have to worry and may continue their SIPs..But if somebody is risk-averse, they might want to cash out their investments.

While we deify certain aspects of mythology,  it is not always a reflection of the realities of our collective  lived existence over several millennia as an Indian civilization. While it is tempting to talk about the \"good\" about our civilization, ( and most often with reference to 'mythologies'), it is only fair to point out  the not so good aspects of our civilization. Both in mythology and reality, our civilization is a case study of patriarchy, misogyny and discrimination ( eg: karna was rarely called Kunti putra but soota putra).   I believe we will only progress as a civilization if we are self critical of bad aspects.\n",

But it is theorized that spike protein based vaccines (either mRNA or adenovirus vectored vaccines like Covishield) may offer some protection. Also vaccines were primarily designed to protect people from severe disease and its main goal was NOT to prevent someone from catching the infection. We saw significant infection in double vaccinated folks even in Delta, but it largely prevented people from getting really sick.  We don’t have enough data to see if vaccination is preventing breakthrough infections or stopping people from catching severe disease. It will take 3-4 weeks to get some sense.

Note: this means that it is “milder” but doesn’t mean everybody will get the mild version. Immunocompromised, old and few unlucky ppl will still get very sick and die\n",

But due to sheer transimissibility, lower % doesn’t mean it wont clog healthcare. For eg.  If 60% less ppl are hospitalized compared delta..it shd mean good news rt? Not really.  UK daily case count rate now is 3 times its delta peak value. And they are very well vaccinated , many with boosters too(UK will reach omicron peak soon)..say delta peak was 10,000/day…and say 500 ppl needed hospitalization/day during delta peak. Say 60% less ppl require hospitalization now..But case count is 30,000/day at omicron peak. So 500*.6*3 = 900 ppl would require hospitzlization. So “mild” during high transimissibility will still burden hospitals, This is key for countries like India.\n",

The positive swabs have to be sent to sequencing labs to check which variant it is (it will take 5-10 days to get that). India sends less than 1% +ve swabs to sequencing labs (UK sends 33%). In UK, France etc, where sequencing is done on significant number of random positive swabs, Omicron is close to 80-90% of cases.  In India also, it is likely beyond 50% already.\n",

Also get a few rapid test kits (costs 250) to see if you are infectious. In US and UK, public health officials have asked ppl to assume they have omicron if they have any cold symptoms so that they don’t spread it around\n",

Getting infected with Omicron provides immunity to Delta (which is more deadlier) – note: the reverse is not true. The way it is transmissible, virologists say that most of us will get infected with Omicron next year..Many of us will not even know when we get it. If there is no other variant of concern in the future, this highly transmissive, but relatively milder disease may signal an end game for this pandemic.\n",

Though my work was around stock market, it was basically time series data, and hence it is domain agnostic, if we have enough data.  I think (I will blame the model if it doesn’t turn out as predicted!), we will see a big surge in Jan -in case counts – peaking around later part of Jan. I just hope the hosptilaztion and morbidity/fatality count is much lower ( I also hope the model is wrong and that we don’t have a surge). even if there is a surge it cant stretch for a few months like delta and it will be over very quickly.  Get boosters when eligible!\n",

Regarding it being mild or it being a nature’s vaccine – it is definitely appearing milder from clinical perspective in the sense that both in UK and SA, lower % of ppl are needing ICU and ventilators. But still a small % of people (both vacced and unvacced) are ending up requiring critical care. As the transmissibility is so high, the absolute count is what matters and we do not know if our hospitals can handle the surge\n",

                        "All the vaccines that are available for covid19 are of non-sterilizing type.  A sterilizing vaccine essentially means , the neutralizing antibodies produced from vaccination will stop the virus from replicating inside the body and stop an infection. Non-sterilizing vaccine cannot prevent infection, but prevents severe disease. Kids actually take a lot of non-sterilizing vaccines. Eg: Rotavrius vaccines given to kids to prevent diarrhea. Kids do get rotavirus related diarrhea after vaccination, but very few get severe disease or die. So the vaccine works. In fact, child mortality is significantly cut due to vaccines. Covid vaccines are also preventing significant deaths/hosptilizations at population scale. A very small % of vaccinated  and a big % of unvaxxed continue to get hospitalized/die. This is NOT in dispute. A good example from NYC\n",

Based on what they learn from real world evidence, they are proposing boosters etc Now, I understand there might be commercial motive by pharma companies, pls note a lot of independent and world class virologists and immunologists support vaccines (and boosters). Also note Flu has a yearly booster shot which reduces the severity of disease.  SO multiple doses doesn’t mean they are ineffective\n",

From a risk perspective, the risk of catching this has grown manifold in the last few days (btw I went to office daily for last 3 months , except for the last week, as the risk was lower .. but I have stopped going now).\n",

Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR)\\nMavalli Tiffin Room\\n\\nMTR was founded as a restaurant by Parampalli Yajnanarayana Maiya and his brothers in the year 1924. The food served at the MTR is a regular, wholesome Karnataka Brahmin fare and has its origins in the Udupi Brahmin cuisine of the coastal region of Karnataka. The decor is outdated, as more attention is paid to cleanliness and food quality than ambiance. For many years, the customers entered the restaurant through the kitchen so that they would be able to satisfy themselves about the restaurant’s cleanliness before they ate there. During World War II, MTR found it difficult to make idlis since rice was in short supply. According to MTR, they experimented with using semolina instead of rice and thus invented the very popular breakfast item of Rava idli.\\n\\nMust Try: Masala Dosa, Rava Idli, Bisibele Bath\\n\\nAddress: 14, Lalbagh Road, Mavalli, Near Basavanagudi, Bangalore\\n\\n2.

The food served at the MTR is a regular, wholesome Karnataka Brahmin fare and has its origins in the Udupi Brahmin cuisine of the coastal region of Karnataka. The decor is outdated, as more attention is paid to cleanliness and food quality than ambiance. For many years, the customers entered the restaurant through the kitchen so that they would be able to satisfy themselves about the restaurant’s cleanliness before they ate there. During World War II, MTR found it difficult to make idlis since rice was in short supply. According to MTR, they experimented with using semolina instead of rice and thus invented the very popular breakfast item of Rava idli.\\n\\nMust Try: Masala Dosa, Rava Idli, Bisibele Bath\\n\\nAddress: 14, Lalbagh Road, Mavalli, Near Basavanagudi, Bangalore\\n\\n2.

Road in Bangalore closed on 5 April 2009, after the Indian Coffee Workers’ Cooperative Society Limited lost a legal battle with the owner of the building to continue in the premises. It has been reopened on Church Street, less than a hundred meters away.\\n\\nMust Try: Masala Dosa, Omelette, Cuttlet, Coffee\\n\\nAddress: 19, Ground Floor, Near Ruby Tuesday, Church Street, Off Brigade Road, Bangalore\\n\\n13.
