26/05/14, 09:43 - Dimpakka: A beautiful speech by Sundar Pichai - an IIT-MIT Alumnus and Global Head Google Chrome:

The cockroach theory for self development
     
At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and  sat on a lady. 

She started screaming out of fear. 

With a panic stricken face and trembling voice,she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.

Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.

The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ...it landed on another lady in the group.

Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.

The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.

In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.

The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.

When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.

Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach 
responsible for their histrionic behavior?

If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?

He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.

It is not the cockroach, but the inability of the ladies to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach that disturbed the ladies.

I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.

It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.

More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.

Lessons learnt from the story:

I understood, I should not react in life.

I should always respond.

The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded.

Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of.
A beautiful way to understand............LIFE.

After they crawled out of their cars, the woman said; “Wow, just look at our cars! There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days.”

The man replied, “I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God!”

The woman continued, “And look at this, here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished, but my bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.” Then she hands the bottle to the man.

The man nods his head in agreement, opens it, drinks half the bottle and then hands it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.

The man asks, “Aren't you having any?”

She replies, “Nah. I think I'll just wait for the police.”

1. Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR)
Mavalli Tiffin Room

MTR was founded as a restaurant by Parampalli Yajnanarayana Maiya and his brothers in the year 1924. The food served at the MTR is a regular, wholesome Karnataka Brahmin fare and has its origins in the Udupi Brahmin cuisine of the coastal region of Karnataka. The decor is outdated, as more attention is paid to cleanliness and food quality than ambiance. For many years, the customers entered the restaurant through the kitchen so that they would be able to satisfy themselves about the restaurant’s cleanliness before they ate there. During World War II, MTR found it difficult to make idlis since rice was in short supply. According to MTR, they experimented with using semolina instead of rice and thus invented the very popular breakfast item of Rava idli.

2. Brahmins Coffee Bar


Brahmin’s Coffee Bar has thrived for 46 years offering just four items: idli, vada, kesari bath and khara bath. Stopping over at the Coffee Bar has become a force of habit for morning joggers, students on their way to college and even devotees of the next door Jain Mandir.

2. There is a claim that the  baby boy was possible due to enhanced and vociferous prayers to various goddesses..(And not the male God)
3) BJPtards are claiming this was possible due to gujarat development model

01/06/14, 19:33 - Baava: Random weekend musings:
---------------------------------------------
I have finally proved everybody lies. Here goes my proof...
Many folks have visited the baby so far. Much against my god given anti-social nature, I have tried my best to engage with all of them..(  I may have ignored those above 75 yrs 
.blame RSS for that.not me)..As is my wont, I have done some analysis on the conversations..Amongst many opinions articulated, the below 2 were common in all the conversations..
1) The baby is very cute
2) The baby looks exactly like me..

I am a trained engineer..if A=B and B=C, A=C..this corollary has withstood scrutiny of hundreds of years of scientific debates..
Now if this is applied to the above 2 opinions, it stands to reason that 
'I AM CUTE!!!!'

Now, nobody (of sound mind) has ever accused me of being even remotely cute..in fact it has been cheekily suggested that my nose comes in the way..so what explains this dichotomy of opinions..
1) All these folks are of unsound mind. Personally I have vague suspicions on a couple of them, but I can't say all of them are crazy(not yet at least)
2) the baby is definitely  cute and some of them are of sound mind..so the logic dictates that the second statement is untrue..
3) So it stands to reason that they were all lying..

05/06/14, 11:24 - Sugama: The link you sent about transferring the contacts using command prompt was feasible bhaava... pappa's memory card could not fit all his contacts. I just tried..  But the contacts were transferred by someone else. So data migration credit goes to a non-engineer 😅
05/06/14, 11:28 - Baava: Did you know if Sugama had lived in the 1930s her usage of the word 'damn'  would have been seen as scandalous.. In that era, 'damn' was seen as a profanity

02/07/14, 19:53 - Puneeth: The top marketing director of Nescafe manages to arrange a meeting with the Pope at the Vatican . 

Nescafe official, 'Your Eminence, I have some business to discuss. We at Nescafe have an offer for you. Nescafe is prepared to donate $100 million to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'." 

The Pope looks outraged and thunders, "That is impossible. The Prayer is the word of the Lord, It must not be changed." 

"Well," says the Nescafe man somewhat chastened, "We anticipated your reluctance. For this reason, and the importance of the Lord's prayer to all Catholics, we will increase our offer to $300 million. All we require is that you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'." 

Again, even more sternly, the Pope replies, "That, my son, is impossible. For the prayer is the word of the Lord and it must not be changed." 

Finally, the Nescafe director says, "Your Holiness, we at Nescafe respect your adherence to your faith, we realize that tradition is essential to your beliefs, we fully understand the importance of the word of the Lord but we do have one final offer. Please discuss it with your cardinals. We will donate $500 million." 

The next day the Pope convenes the College of Cardinals. "There is some Good news," he announces, "and some bad news..... The good news is, he continues to a hushed assembly, that the Church will get $500 million." 
"And what is the bad news, your Holiness?" asks a Cardinal. 

"Sadly" says the Pope, "We would have to close the Britannia Account."

03/07/14, 13:03 - +91 99029 11883: About Kannada Language:

Kannada is the third oldest language of World. (After . . . Sanskrit & Greek) 
is as old as 2000 years. 

Kannada is 99.99% perfect -logically and scientifically. 

Kannadaigas got 8 Gnana Peetha Awards. Look at other languages . . . Hindi -- 6, Telugu - 2, Malayalam - 3, Tamil - 2. 

Shri VINOBA BHAVE called Kannada script as QUEEN OF WORLD SCRIPTS - "Vishwa LipigaLa RaaNi - Kannada "

So called International language -- English does not have its own Script. English is written in "ROMAN" 

So called National Language -- Hindi does not have its own script. Hindi is written in "Deva nagari" 

Though Tamil has a script, logically it is imperfect -- as common letters are used for many pronunciations.. 

Kannada is as old as 2000 years. You can write what you speak and you can read what you write. 

When " Kaviraja Maarga was written . . ."kaaveriyinda , godaavarivaregirpa ... " by Amogha Varsha Nripathunga, English was incradle & Hindi was not born at all. 

Kannada is the only Indian language for which a foreigner (Kittal) wrote a dictionary (Shabda Kosha)

Ragale Saahithya can be seen only in Kannada which is of a rare and different kind of literature. 

Number of literature awards KUVEMPU got, was highest among any Indian authors. 

Kannada Chandassu (shatpadis) out pared all other languages. 

So Let us have PRIDE in using Kannada . Be proud of being a KANNADIGA.

Forward this to all your friends and let them also be PROUD to be KANNADIGAS.

Husband’s Message (by cellphone):

Honey,  I got hit by a car outside of the office.  Teena brought me to the
Hospital. They have been making tests and taking X-rays. The blow to my head
though very strong, will not have any serious or lasting injury. But, I have
three broken ribs, a broken arm, a compound fracture in the left leg, and
they may have to amputate the right foot.

Who is Teena?

03/07/14, 20:53 - Puneeth: A man on a Goa beach was deep in prayer.

Suddenly, the sky clouded above his head and, in a booming voice, the Lord said, “Because you have been faithful to me in all ways, I will grant you one wish.”

The man said, “Build a bridge from Goa to Mumbai so I can drive over anytime I want.”

The Lord said, “Your request is very materialistic. Think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom! The concrete and steel it would take! It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. I can do it, but it is hard for me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more time and think of something better”

The man thought about it for a long time. Finally he said, “Lord, I wish that I could understand my wife. I want to know how she feels inside, what she’s thinking when she gives me the silent treatment, why she cries, what she means when she says nothing wrong, and how I can make a woman truly happy.”

The Lord replied, “You want 2 lanes or 4 lanes on that bridge?”😆😆😆

WHERE YOUR LIFE STANDS
HERE ON EARTH.....
IT IS LIKE NOON IN YOUR LIFE.....

Because none of us have many more years to live, optimistically we are in mid life or 2nd half of life & we can't take along anything when we go... 

Spend the money 
that should be spent,
enjoy what should be enjoyed, donate what you are able to donate, but don't make your children & grandchildren become parasites who may be waiting for the day you will die!!

Don't worry about what will happen after we are gone, because when we return to dust, we will feel nothing about praises or criticisms. The time to enjoy the worldly life and your hard earned wealth will be over !!!

Don't worry too much about your children, for children will have  their own destiny & should find their own way....

Don't be your children's slave.
Care for them, love them, give them gifts, but also enjoy your moments.... Enjoy your money while you can.

Life should have more to it than working from cradle to grave.

One day passes without happiness, you will lose one day.
One day passes with happiness,
then you gain one day.

In good spirit,
sickness will cure...
In a happy spirit,
sickness will cure faster..
In high & happy spirits;
sickness will never come...

Above all, learn to cherish the goodness around... and FRIENDS... They all make you feel young & "wanted".....Without them, you are 
surely to feel lost !!

Stress means the gap between expectations & reality.
More the gap, more the stress.
Expect nothing 
& accept everything....

Don't believe in Tit for Tat rule...
because we can't bite a dog who has bitten us...so don't spoil our level just to teach others..... 

Moral......
"Think twice..Act wise.."

Learn to "LET GO"....
Because You cannot have the next breath until you let go  the existing one...

19/07/14, 10:22 - Manumama: 7 Doctors and 7 engineers are going from PUNE to Mumbai.

So they both gather at Pune Station.

Both groups are desperately trying to prove their superiority.

SCENE 1 (PUNE- MUMBAI) :

---------------------------------------

7 doctors take only 1 Ticket and 7 engineers buy all 7 tickets..

Engineers desperately waiting for TC to come......

When TC arrives,

All 7 doctors get in one toilet So when TC knocks , one hand come out with the ticket and the TC goes away....

----------------------------------------



NOW on return Journey All of them don't get a direct train to PUNE.
So they all decide to take a Passenger till Lonavala, from there they can easily get a LOCAL to PUNE

SCENE 2 (MUMBAI - LONAVALA) :

---------------------------------------------

Engineers decided, "this time we will prove that we too are equal"....All 7 engineers take 1 Ticket. Doctors don't buy any ticket at
all!!!!!..

TC arrives....

ALL ENGINEERS  IN ONE TOILET.ALL DOCTORS IN THE OPPOSITE ONE..

One doctors gets out and knocks the door of engineers toilet, One Hand comes with the tickets, he takes the ticket and comes in docs
Bathroom...

TC DRIVES out ALL the engineers from the toilet and they are heavily fined

---------------------------------------------

SCENE 3 ( LONAVALA) :

-----------------------------------------

SO now both the group r on LONAVALA station. Engineers planning their move for last chance, they board the local to Pune.

This time engineers decide that they will play the same(1 ticket) trick.

ALL engineers take 1 tickets...doctors BUY all 7 tickets this time...

SO TC Comes. All doctors showed their tickets.....

Engineers still searching for toilet in the LOCAL train...........

----------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion: don't mess with doctors

Do read it properly !!

1. Name the 5 Wealthiest People in the world.

2. Name the Last 5 winners of Ms. Universe.

3. Name the Last 10 People Who won the Nobel prize.

How Did You Do?
.

The Point is, None of us Remembers The Headlines of Yesterday,

Even Though These People Must be the Best in Their Fields

Applause Dies,

Awards Are Tarnished and Achievements
Are Forgotten!!

Here's another quiz:

Let's see How This Goes:

1. Name 5 Teachers Who Added Your Journey Through School.

2. Name 5 Friends Who Helped You Thru Difficult Times.

3. Name 5 People Who Taught You Something Worthwhile.

4. Name 5 People Who Make's You Feel Special.

5. Name 5 People You Enjoy Spending Time with.
.
.
.

Easier...right?

The People Who Make a Difference in ur Life Are NOT the ones with Most Awards and Loads of money.

Life is Full of ordinary People Who Have Made the World a Better Place for You!

Cherish them!

Hold Them Tight!

Perhaps Sometimes its Special to be ordinary!!

09/08/14, 09:51 - +91 99029 11883: There is currently an Ebola outbreak putting all of us at risk. Pls help educate all around u by sending this msg to all your contacts..

What is EBOLA?

It's a virus that attacks a person blood system:

Ebola is what scientists call a haemorraghic fever - it operates by making its victims bleed from almost
anywhere on their body.
Usually victims bleed to
death.

Ebola is highly contagious;
Being transmitted via
contact with body fluids
such as blood, sweat, saliva,
semen or other body discharges.

Ebola is however NOT AN AIRBORNE VURUS!

EXTREMELY deadly:
About 90% of people that
catch Ebola will die from it.
It's one of the deadliest
diseases in the world,
killing in just a few weeks.

Untreatable(no cure):
Ebola has no known treatment or cure.
Victims are usually treated for symptoms with the faint hope that they
recover.

How Do I Know Someone has Ebola?

•Fever
•Headache
•Diarrhoea
•Vomiting
•Weakness
•Joint & Muscle pains
•Stomach Pain
•Lack of Appetite

Protect Yourself:
•Wash Your Hands
with Soap
Do this a lot. You can
also use a good hand
sanitizer. Avoid
unnecessary physical contact with people.

■Restrict yourself to food you prepared yourself.

■Disinfect Your Surroundings
The virus cannot
survive disinfectants,heat, direct sunlight,detergents and soaps.

Clean up!:
•Fumigate If you have Pests.
•Rodents can be carriers of Ebola.
•Fumigate your environment & dispose off the carcasses properly!
•Dead bodies CAN still
transmit Ebola. 
•Don't touch them without
protective gear or better yet avoid them altogether.

Protect Yourself:
•Use protective gear if you
must care or go near
someone you suspect has
Ebola.

Report:
•Report any suspicious
symptoms in yourself or
anyone else IMMEDIATELY. 

Do not delay!

Educate Everyone:
•Tell your neighbours,
colleagues and domestic
staff (anyone really). Basically you're safer when
everyone is educated.

20/08/14, 12:25 - Sinchana: Priest's Retirement Speech     
  
A Priest was being honoured at his retirement dinner after 25 years in the parish.
                             
The leading local politician  was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner.
 
However, he was late, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited: 

He commenced with: “Thank Goodness we Catholics have a wonderful sense of humour!” 
  
“I got my first impression of this parish from the very first confession I ever heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it.  He had stolen money from his parents;  embezzled from his employer;  had an affair with his boss’s wife;  had sex with his boss’s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions,  taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs;  was arrested several times for public nudity.  I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things.  But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.” 
  
Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk: 
  
“I’ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,” said the politician.  “In fact, I had the honor of being the first person to go to him for confession.” 
  
  
Moral: Never, Never, Never Be Late
20/08/14, 15:08 - +91 91411 85869:  A very  beautiful message which I got as a forward...

According to an old Hindu legend, there was a time when all human beings were gods, but they abused their divinity. 

So, Brahma, the chief God, decided to take the divinity away from them and hide it somewhere they could never find it. 

Brahma called a council of the gods to help him decide where to hide the divinity.
“Let’s bury it deep in the earth,” said the gods. But Brahma answered, “Humans will dig into the earth and find it.” 

Some gods suggested, “Let’s sink it in the deepest ocean.” But Brahma said, “No, Human will learn to dive into the ocean and will
find it.” 

Then some gods suggested, “Let’s take it to the top of the highest mountain and hide it there.”

Brahma replied, “Human will eventually climb every mountain and take up their divinity.” Then all the gods gave up and said, “We do not know where to hide it, because it
seems that there is no place on earth or ocean that human beings will not eventually reach.”

Brahma thought for a long time said, “We will hide their divinity deep into the center of their own being, Humans will search
for it here and there but they wont look for the divinity inside their true selves”
All the gods agreed that this was the perfect hiding place, and the deed was done. 

And since then, humans have been going up and down the earth, digging, diving, climbing, and exploring, searching for something, which already lies within
themselves.

“Divinity lies within us all"💞

24/08/14, 09:17 - Manumama: All mothers will enjoy this
24/08/14, 22:40 - +91 99029 11883: How important 
is a father in one’s life?

Mothers are the Soul of our homes... whereas fathers are their very existence.

But have we ever given much thought to the nature of this 
existence?

Little is written or said about fathers, even though we understand their value in our lives.

We hardly ever hear anyone talk about fathers. .. 
Mothers are made of an ocean of tears. Fathers are a wall of self-control.

Mothers relieve their pain through tears, fathers only console, and it is harder to console than it is to cry. 

Surely the candlestick is hotter than the flame, yet
it is always the flame which gets the praise.

We remember mother as the one who took care of our daily needs, yet how easily we forget the father, who arrange finances for daily needs!

Mothers can cry uncontrollably in public, n fathers sob in their pillow at night.

Mothers are allowed to cry; fathers can never be seen in tears.

We can notice the patches on his shoes. His tattered vest is a sure sign of the struggle he gone through. His unshaven beard is a sign of his frugality. He will buy new pairs of expensive jeans for his children, while an old pair of pyjamas will do for him.

While children don’t blink an eyelid when they spend 1000's of Rs in a beauty parlour or salon, yet in their own home, a father may be using talcum soap to shave because his shaving cream is finished, or he might be shaving
in just water.

When father is ill, he does 
not rush to the doctor. He does not fear his illness
but is afraid in case the doctor tells him to rest for a month, as there will be no other bread earner in the family.

Whether he can afford it 
or not, he works hard to get his son admitted to an
engineering or medical course.
Despite the shortage of funds he send money regularly to his child at university even some children go on a gala spending spree on the same day the money arrives.

Father is the existence of the 
home. The home is secure from outsiders when a father, in the form of its manger, is alive. He holds the position of the chief executive of the household. He sees, repairs and cares for jobs around the house.

When you announce your exam results, it seems that mother is the closest person to you because she takes you in her arms, praises you and blesses you, but no one notices the father who quietly slips away to the sweet shop to get sweets to distribute among family and friends...

Salute to All Fathers of d world....

17/09/14, 16:08 - Puneeth: The 8 Monkeys:

(This is reportedly based on an actual experiment conducted in the U.K.)

Put eight monkeys in a room. In the middle of the room is a ladder, leading to a bunch of bananas hanging from a hook on the ceiling.

Each time a monkey tries to climb the ladder, all the monkeys are sprayed with ice water, which makes them miserable. Soon enough, whenever a monkey attempts to climb the ladder, all of the other monkeys, not wanting to be sprayed, set upon him and beat him up. Soon, none of the eight monkeys ever attempts to climb the ladder.

One of the original monkeys is then removed, and a new monkey is put in the room. Seeing the bananas and the ladder, he wonders why none of the other monkeys are doing the obvious. But undaunted, he immediately begins to climb the ladder.

All the other monkeys fall upon him and beat him silly. He has no idea why.

However, he no longer attempts to climb the ladder.

A second original monkey is removed and replaced. The newcomer again attempts to climb the ladder, but all the other monkeys hammer the crap out of him.

This includes the previous new monkey, who, grateful that he's not on the receiving end this time, participates in the beating because all the other monkeys are doing it. However, he has no idea why he's attacking the new monkey

One by one, all the original monkeys are replaced. Eight new monkeys are now in the room. None of them have ever been sprayed by ice water. None of them attempt to climb the ladder. All of them will enthusiastically beat up any new monkey who tries, without having any idea why.

And that is how some traditions, religions and systems get established and followed.

Teacher : Whats your name ?

Boy : Nadir

Teacher : No, now you are in America, your name is Johnny from today.

Boy went home and his mother asked: How was the day Nadir?

Boy : I am an American now, so call me Johnny.

Mom and Dad both got offended and beat him up.
Next day he was back to school all bruised ...

Teacher : What happened Johnny ?

Boy: Ma'm, just 6 hours after I became American, I was attacked by two Pakistani terrorists

"Friends, there are

Life is not about what

it's about what you can 
still do. 
Wait n dont ever give up..
Miracles happen every 
day....
                              
Rs.20 seems too much 
to give a beggar but it
seems okay when its 
given as tip at a fancy
restaurant.

After a whole day of 
work, Hours at the gym
seem alright but helping
your Mother out at home 
seems like a burden.

Praying to god for 3 min
takes too much time but
watching a movie for 3
hours doesn't.


Wait a whole year for
Valentine's day but we
always forget Mother's 
day.

Two poor starving kids
sitting on the pavement
weren't given even a slice 
of Bread but a painting of
them sold for lakhs of
Rupees.

We don't think twice 
About forwarding jokes 
But we will rethink about
sending this message on.

Think about It..
Make a change.

20/10/14, 17:13 - Manumama: Sujathu, this is the irony of life. We cannot take examples of miracles and no body is bothered about those who worked hard like vishweshwara has for ex !!!! To make it . They are in plenty.
20/10/14, 17:23 - Krishna uncle: Well said Manu ! And you are the one who can say this always ! Seriously, Sujathakka and many in our family  believe in hard work. Only people like me wait for miracles to happen !
21/10/14, 12:16 - +91 99029 11883: E-Mail Note from a man in Sheffield to his friend in Birmingham:
 
 I was fed up with being burgled every other day in my neighbourhood. So, I tore out my alarm system & de-registered from our local Neighbourhood Watch.

 I've planted a Pakistani flag in each corner of my front garden and a large Black Flag of ISIS in its centre.
  
 Now,the Yorkshire police, the National Security Bureau, Scotland Yard, MI-5, MI-6, the CIA and every other intelligence service in Europe are all watching my house 24x7x365. 
  
 My children are followed to school every day and my wife when she goes shopping.  I'm followed to and from work every day.  So no one bothers me at all.
  
 I've never felt safer...

😎😎😎
21/10/14, 16:01 - Sinchana: A beautiful poem: 
--- 

The World is Mine 
--------------------

 Today, upon a bus, I saw a very beautiful woman,
 And wished I were as beautiful.
 When suddenly she rose to leave,
 I saw her hobble down the aisle.
 She had one leg and wore a crutch.
 But as she passed, she passed a smile.
 Oh, God, forgive me when I whine.
 I have two legs; the world is mine.

 I stopped to buy some candy,
 The man who sold it had such charm,
 I talked with him, he seemed so glad,
 If I were late, it'd do no harm.
 And as I left, he said to me,
 "I thank you, you've been so kind.
 It's nice to talk with folks like you.
 You see," he said, "I'm blind."
 Oh, God, forgive me when I whine.
 I have two eyes; the world is mine.

 Later while walking down the street,
 I saw a child I knew.
 He stood and watched the others play,
 but he did not know what to do.
 I stopped a moment and then I said,
 "Why don't you join them dear?"
 He looked ahead without a word,
 I forgot, he couldn't hear.
 Oh, God, forgive me when I whine,
 I have two ears; the world is mine.

 With feet to take me where I'd go,
 With eyes to see the sunset's glow,
 With ears to hear what I'd know.
 With loving family & friends to enjoy life
 Oh, God, forgive me when I whine,
 I've been blessed indeed, the world is mine.
-------
 After all, it's just a simple reminder that we have so much to be thankful for!

Give the gift of love.
It never comes back empty 😊

04/11/14, 20:46 - +91 98441 06203: During a robbery in Hong Kong, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: 
"Don't move. The money belongs to the Government. Your life belongs to you."

Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. 

 
This is called "Mind Changing Concept” Changing the conventional way of thinking.

When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her:
"Please be civilised! This is a robbery and not a rape!" 

 
This is called "Being Professional” 
Focus only on what you are trained to do! 

When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school):
"Big brother, let's count how much we got." 

 
The older robber rebutted and said:
"You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!" 

 
This is called "Experience” 
Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! 

After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: 
"Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”.

 
This is called "Swim with the tide” 
Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage!

The supervisor says: "It will be good if there is a robbery every month."  

 
This is called "Changing priority” 
Personal Happiness is more important than your job”.

The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. 

 
The robbers were very angry and complained:
"We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!" 

 
This is called "Knowledge is worth as much as gold!"

======== 

  Ⓜ Who is a MAN

A man is the most beautiful part of God's creation.

  He sacrifices his chocolates🍬 for his  sister.

He sacrifices his dreams 💭for just a  smile on his parents' face.

  He spends his entire pocket money on buyng gifts for the lady 👰     he loves💞 just to see her smiling

He sacrifices his full youth for his wife & children👪 by working late   at night without any complaint.

He builds 🏡their future by taking loans from banks & repaying them for lifetime.

 He struggles a lot & still has to bear scolding from his mother, wife  & boss.

His life finally ends up only by compromising for others'   happiness.

If he goes out, then he's careless 

If he stays at home, then he's a lazy

If he scolds children, then he's a monster 

If he doesn't scold, then he's a irresponsible guy

If he stops wife from working, then he's an insecure guy

If he doesn't stops wife from working, then he's somebody who lives on wife's earnings 

If he listens to mom, then he's mama's boy

If he listens to wife, he's wife's slave


  Respect every male in your life. U will never know what he has sacrificed 4U.

Worth sending to every man to make him smile & every woman to make her realize his worth!!

"When I was a kid, my Mom cooked food for us.
One night in particular when she had made dinner after a long hard day's work, Mom placed a plate of subzi and extremely burnt roti in front of my Dad.
I was waiting to see if anyone noticed the burnt roti.
But Dad just ate his roti and asked me how was my day was at school.
I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember I heard Mom apologising to Dad for the burnt roti.
And I'll never forget what he said: "Honey, I love burnt roti."
Later that night, I went to kiss Daddy, good night & I asked him if he really liked his roti burnt.
He wrapped me in his arms & said: "Your momma put in a long hard day at work today and she was really tired.
And besides... A burnt roti never hurts anyone but harsh words do!"
"You know beta - life is full of imperfect things... & imperfect people...
I'M NOT THE BEST & AM HARDLY GOOD AT ANYTHING!
I forget birthdays & anniversaries just like everyone else.
What I've learnt over the years is :
To Accept Each Others Faults & Choose To Celebrate Relationships"
Life Is Too Short To Wake Up With Regrets!
Love the people who treat you right & have compassion for the ones who don't...
!!! ENJOY LIFE NOW !!!
It has an expiry date !!..

08/01/15, 16:26 - Puneeth: 🚫Appraisal Special ...

There was a farmer who had a horse and a goat…..

One day, the horse became ill and he called the veterinarian, who said: Well, your horse has a virus. He must take this medicine for three days. I'll come back on the 3rd day and if he's not better, we're going to have to put him down.

Nearby, the goat listened closely to their conversation.

The next day, they gave him the medicine and left.

The goat approached the horse and said: - Be strong,  friend. Get up or else they're going to put you to sleep!

On the second day, they gave him the medicine and left.

The goat came back and said: - Come on buddy, get up or else you're going to die! Come on, I'll help you get up.
Let's go! One, two, three...

On the third day, they came to give him the medicine and the vet said:- Unfortunately, we're going to have to put him down tomorrow. Otherwise, the virus might spread and infect the other horses.

After they left, the goat approached the horse and said: Listen pal, it's now or never! Get up, come on! Have courage! Come on! Get up! Get up! That's it, slowly! Great! Come on, one, two, three... Good, good. Now faster, come on...... Fantastic! Run, run more!
Yes! Yay! Yes! You did it, you're a champion!!!

All of a sudden, the owner came back, saw the horse running in the field and began shouting: It's a miracle! My horse is cured. We must have a grand party. Let's Cook the goat!!!! 😳😭😷😢 

Lesson:
Whatever you do, always mark a Cc to your boss. 😝😝😝

A FATHER Asked His DAUGHTER:
Who Would U Love More, Me Or Ur Husband..??

I Don't Know Really,
But When I See U, 
I Forget Him,
But When I See Him, 
I Remember U..

U Can Always Call Ur DAUGHTER As Beta, 
But U Can Never Call Ur Son As Beti..

That's Why DAUGHTERS are SPECIAL

03/02/15, 16:42 - Sinchana: Ek ghar me saas-bahu bahot pyar se rehte the..

ek baar ghar me ek guest aya..

bahu ne saas ko uss guest se baat karte suna..

saas keh rhi thi 'Beti shakkar ki tarah hoti h aur bahu namak ki tarah'..

ye sun kar bahu ko bahot bura laga..

wo udas rehne lagi..

jab saas ko is baat ka pata chala to bahu se kaaran puchha..

bahu ne kaaran bataya.

Tab saas ne hans kar kaha 'uss baat ka matlab he..

beti shakkar ki tarah hoti h jo har haal me mithi lagti h

 jabki bahu namak ki tarah hoti h jiska karz nhi chukaya ja sakta
Jinke bina har cheez ka swaad be-swaad ho jaata hai"......👌👌👌

So ALL BAHURANIS CHEER UP 😀😘😊😃 YOU ARE THE BEST👍

Wife 1: I had a fine evening, how was Urs???

Wife 2 : It was a disaster. My husband came home, ate his dinner in 3 mins & fell asleep in 2 mins. How was yours?

Wife 1 : Oh mine was amazing ! My husband came home and took me out for a romantic dinner. 🍲 After dinner we walked for an hour.👫 When we came home he lit the candles around the house. It was like a fairy tale ! 

 At the same time, their husbands are talking at work..

Husband 1: How was your evening?

Husband 2: Great. I came home, dinner was on the table, I ate & fell asleep. What about you ?

Husband 1: It was horrible. I came home, there's no dinner, they cut the electricity because I forgot to pay the bill; so I took her out for dinner which was so expensive that didn't have money left for a cab or auto.We walked home which took an hour & when we got home I remembered there was no electricity so I had to light candles all over the house !!!!!!

15/02/15, 09:13 - Anitha Athe: Cute Letter from a newly married girl to her mother

Dear mom,

Like every normal girl, I was excited about marriage right from my childhood days. I never thought beyond the time that I would spend happily with my prince charming. 

But today when I am married, I realize that marriage is not all roses. It’s not just about being with your beloved and having a gala time. There is so much more to it. It comes with its own share of responsibilities, duties, sacrifices and compromises. 

I can’t wake up anytime I want to. 
I am expected to be up and ready before everyone else in the family. 
I can’t laze around in my pyjamas throughout the day. 
I am expected to be presentable every time. 
I can’t just go out anytime I want to. 
I am expected to be sensitive to the needs of the family. 
I just can’t hit the bed anytime I want to. 
I am expected to be active and around the family. 
I can’t expect to be treated like a princess but am supposed to take care of everyone else in the family. 

And then I think to myself, ‘why did I get married at all?’ I was happier with you, mom. Sometimes I think of coming back to you and getting pampered again. 

I want to come home to my favourite food cooked by you every evening after a nice outing with friends. I want to sleep on your laps like I have no worry in this world. But then I suddenly realize, had you not got married and made such sacrifices in your life, I wouldn’t have had so many wonderful memories to hang on to. And suddenly, the purpose of all this becomes clear- to return the same comfort, peace and happiness to my new family that I got from you.

And I am sure that as time would pass, I would start loving this life equally as you do. Thank you mom for all the sacrifices and compromises you made. They give me the strength to do the same. Love you.

It's an excellent article for all daughters 

Do not forget to Share with ladies... respect all ladies and girls beside u as they make the world beautiful for u to live in.

Daughters are like music in the house..

When she speaks,
Speaks without a break..
& everyone says,
"chup bhi kar jao"

When she is silent,
mother says,
"tabiyat theek hai na"

Father says,
"aaj ghar mein khamoshi kyun hai"

Bhai says,
"naraaz ho kya"

and when she is married, all says,
"aisa lagta hai is ghar ki raunak hi chali gai"

She is the real non stop music..

Dedicated to emotional, cute, pretty, sweet & sincere girls

That's Me..
That's You..
That's a Girl..

01/03/15, 15:31 - Baava: Only last item is new. Health insurance premium amt increased by 10K..net-net no real benefit for us😞
01/03/15, 15:32 - Baava: But service tax effectively is 16% + now due to increase and additional cess
So in effect this budget means more tax !
01/03/15, 15:34 - Puneeth: Service tax increase is the real disappointment. 😞
01/03/15, 15:36 - Baava: True..it is BIG. We all worry about direct tax like income tax..but it is the indirect taxes like service tax which take more money from us..
01/03/15, 15:38 - Puneeth: As simple as Eating out will b a luxury.
01/03/15, 15:39 - Baava: Yeah😞
01/03/15, 15:41 - Baava: There is a fundamental shift..more reliance on indirect tax than direct tax for fiscal revenue accrual which is not good for us.note corp tax reduction will not affect us but govt has to make up the loss with indirect tax like service tax
01/03/15, 15:42 - Baava: It will only help investors and promoters.. As more money will be disbursed as dividends to them..note: unlike infy, RIL and adani shares are predominantly held by the promoters.. So u know who benefits

● changes her name..

● changes her home..

● leaves her family..

● moves in with you..

● builds a home with you..

● gets pregnant for you..

● pregnancy changes her body..

● she gets fat..

● almost gives up in the labour room due to the unbearable pain of child birth..

● even the kids she delivers bear your name..

Till the day she dies.. everything she does... cooking, cleaning your house, taking care of your parents, bringing up your children, earning, advising you, ensuring you can be relaxed, maintaining all family relations, everything that benefit you.. sometimes at the cost of her own health, hobbies and beauty.

So who is really doing whom a favour?

Dear men, appreciate the women in your lives always, because it is not easy to be a woman.

*Being a woman is priceless*

Happy International women's Day !!!

Pass this to every woman in your contact to make her feel proud of herself.

Rock the world ladies!

A salute to ladies!

WOMAN MEANS:-

W ➖ WONDERFUL MOTHER.
O ➖ OUTSTANDING FRIEND.
M ➖ MARVELLOUS DAUGHTER.
A ➖ ADORABLE SISTER.
N ➖ NICEST GIFT TO MEN FROM GOD.

Pass to every women to feel proud!

16/03/15, 16:56 - Geethathe: Very interesting and worth reading story titled The Stranger. It will open your eyes to the reality of this generation. 


A few years after I was born, my Dad met a stranger who was new to our small town. It was 1983. 

From the beginning, Dad was fascinated with this enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with our family. The stranger was quickly accepted and was around from then on.

As I grew up, I never questioned his place in my family. In my young mind, he had a special niche.

My parents were complementary instructors: 
Mom taught me good from evil, and 
Dad taught me to obey.

But the stranger... 
He was d storyteller. He would keep us spellbound for hours on end with adventures, mysteries and comedies.

If I wanted to know anything about politics, history or science, he always knew the answers about the past, understood the present and even seemed able to predict the future! 

He took my family to the first cricket tournament. He made me laugh, and he made me cry. The stranger never stopped talking, but Dad didn't seem to mind.

Sometimes, Mom would get up quietly while the rest of us were shushing each other to listen to what he had to say, and she would go to the kitchen for peace and quiet.

(I wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger to leave.)

Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions, but the stranger never felt obligated to honor them.

Obscenity, for example, was not allowed in our home - not from us, our friends or any visitors. Our long time visitor, however, got away with four-letter words that burned my ears and made my dad squirm and my mother blush.

My Dad didn't permit the liberal use of alcohol but the stranger encouraged us to try it on a regular basis. 

He made cigarettes look cool, cigars manly, and pipes distinguished.

He talked freely (much too freely!) about lewd things. His comments were sometimes blatant, sometimes suggestive, and generally embarrassing..

I now know that my early concepts about relationships were influenced strongly by the stranger. 


Time after time, he opposed the values of my parents, yet he was seldom rebuked... And NEVER asked to leave.

More than 30 years have passed since the stranger moved in with our family. He has blended right in and is not nearly as fascinating as he was at first. Still, if you could walk into my den today, you would still find him sitting over in his corner, waiting for someone to listen to him talk and watch him draw his pictures.

His name?....









We just call him 'TV.'😁😁😁

He got married a decade ago. His wife......we call her 'Computer.'😂😂😂

Their first child is 'Smart Phone' born in 2008 and the second child "iPod " born 2010
😂😂😂




And just last year they had a grandchild the iPad. 😂😂😂



 The great grand child is expected soon this year end ................

18/03/15, 18:24 - Kampa Aunt: Preliminary report says D K Ravi's lungs are compressed. It appears to be a planned murder. Spread the msg.
I m deeply saddened with the death of dk Ravi ...this I'd say 100% murder possible by space spray poison malathion and pyrithrum space spray also co poisoning and injection in interiginous areas ie  between skin n nails ..by three international  proffesional killers in between 11.30 to 12.noon ..and body was tied over neck by cloth not thin enough to obstruct airways at all ..its wide cloth ..also suspects in my view are from Dubai or Europe ..backed by jewellers ...builders mafia ...my suspicion goes to posiible links between  national market  ....along with top builders nexus to terminate ...him ...I only hope all possible viscera shall b preserved for rarest possible toxins ...which are undetectable in routine protocol ...also his clean shaved mustache chin was blue ....? Poison like methyl isocyanate ....and co can create this ... This is instituted by three men came to meet him by disguise of income tax officers ..if they are it officers why they are not seen now... Hence footage of that CCTV shud  b sought for examination .. And all Dubai and forieign national exits from airport s to be monitered with the description matching security guard in that apartment ...also from that CCTV footage.. 9 0 clock first case of pm today by hod and senior faculty
I only hope this case shud be solved and killers shed be hanged not life time imprisonment.. Not that Appeal drama....etc ....rip..dk Ravi a fighter not a suicider at all....I m upset about system and ill fate of these officers....

18/03/15, 21:24 - Manumama: @ naveen . What u say about the suraksha sukanya scheme
18/03/15, 21:27 - Manumama: If u pay 1000/ month
1000x12 : 12000/ year ..14 years 
Lock on period 7 years 
Total pavement : 1.68 for 14 years 
After 7 years and at the end of 21 years u receive 6.32/or so lac which is 3.8 times of 1.68. No TDS . Tax exemption . 
Wats ur take on this scheme
18/03/15, 21:32 - Sinchana: Thank u Geethatte..
18/03/15, 21:33 - Sinchana: Thank u Manumaama
18/03/15, 21:41 - Baava: Sukanya samruddi present interest rate comes to around 9.1%. Not much higher than PPF with exactly the same tax treatment. So its not really great in that sense.  Over a period of 21 years equity funds should give much larger returns
18/03/15, 21:46 - Baava: But this is the highest interest being paid by govt for any of its schemes
18/03/15, 21:48 - Manumama: Equity should give . But is it guaranteed !!
18/03/15, 21:49 - Baava: No😛
18/03/15, 21:53 - Baava: But over such a long time equity almost always returns more..note sensex was 2000 in 1993 and it is now 28-30,000..not guaranteed but safe to assume they will beat govt rates over 2 decades
18/03/15, 22:03 - Manumama: But after 14 years the amount is giving dividend of 20 % every year upto 7 years according to the predicted amount which is equivalent to land rates . It's giving compound interest !!
18/03/15, 22:09 - Baava: I will check..but the lock in is based on the age of the girl if I recall and not 7 yrs after investment.. But 20% is too good to be true..if it is true I will put all my money..even the government bonds give max 8.5%..I doubt any govt supported instrument will give double digit % when they are borrowing at 8+%..they can't afford
18/03/15, 22:14 - Manumama: Today o heard the interview 
For ex 
Every month 1000x 12= 12000. For this 9.2% interest
Next year it is compounded with additional amount x 14 years . This is giving on an average 12% over period for 14 years 
After 14 years of the amount becomes 6.32 then it is 20 % year but that is after 14 years 
Lock in is 7 years 
At 18 you can draw 50 % for education 
At 21, rest for marriage
18/03/15, 22:17 - Manumama: < 10 years girls . Eligibility
18/03/15, 22:18 - Baava: Yes..it is always compounded.. At CAGR of 9.1%..I think  they say 12 % as they are considering 80C savings also in calculation ( which shd not be done as ur PF , home loan etc will hit 1.5 L easily)..
18/03/15, 22:19 - Baava: I had actually calculated this after budget and had felt it is just slightly better than PPF
18/03/15, 22:20 - Baava: Pls note any govt backed returns can never be greater than personal loan rates offered by banks (approx 13-14%).. I can just borrow and make risk free money at 6%
18/03/15, 22:22 - Baava: Anyway I will read the terms..too lazy to do it now😛
18/03/15, 22:22 - Manumama: But you are not eligible for that amount . She is at 21
18/03/15, 22:22 - Baava: Yes..that was just theory..
18/03/15, 22:22 - Manumama: Just check . Seems interesting .gn
18/03/15, 22:23 - Baava: I mean if this is true it will be good news for gender ratio😝

The lady officer who is presently posted in Karnataka and is married to a software Engineer turned realtor.

The lady officer has assured to co-operate with the investigating officers.

It is said that Ravi’s marriage turned sour when his wife discovered of his one-sided love and threatened him of filing a dowry harassment case against him.

The dejection of being rejected by his love interest and pressure mounting at the family front could have had led Ravi to take this extreme step, it is now said.

Ravi, a 2009 IAS batch stood 34th rank while the lady in question stood 43rd rank.
20/03/15, 15:44 - Baava: One-sided love claimed D K Ravi's life?

￼

Bengaluru : A new turn in IAS officer DK Ravi’s death case brings his IAS batch mate in eye of storm.

If sources are to be believed, DK Ravi was in love with his IAS batch mate and on Monday, March 16, he had called her almost 44 times.

It is said that Ravi had persistently pleaded her to marry him and the batch mate had continuously rejected the plea. Dejected by the same, on Monday he had even sent her an SMS stating that he would resort to taking a drastic step, in response to which, the lady in question had said “You are kidding”.

However, the last SMS sent by Ravi to the woman read: “Good Bye, We will meet in next life.”

It is said that the lady officer had met the Chief Secretary Kaushik Mukherjee in Bengaluru and let out several details, including the point that Ravi had proposed to her several times, which she turned down. With this, she had scotched all the rumours linking her up with Ravi.

20/03/15, 16:33 - Baava: Why CBI..it is as independent as our CID. Both under govt control..I don't understand why CBI is seen as a savior...all the scams it investigated were under  SC supervision and not by govt
20/03/15, 16:33 - Baava: Pls note CBI is controlled by mass murderers like Modi and Shah
20/03/15, 16:35 - Baava: Like election commission which is a statutory body and independent
20/03/15, 16:35 - Baava: Unless CID and CBI are made independent it doesn't matter esp when state and central governments are ruled by diff parties
20/03/15, 16:37 - Baava: In a federal setup I am against Central agencies investigating a crime which is a state subject
20/03/15, 16:37 - Baava: Note how CBI is used to hound Mamata in WB..
20/03/15, 18:43 - Puneeth: Totally agree abt the sorry state of how our CBI operates. Mere puppets.

21/03/15, 11:23 - Madhumama: Probably it is suicide case only
CBI pressure; is a political drama and fear
Reason is, many things get unearthed in the process of this investigation.
 CID is under state control so the findings can be locked without exposing. In case of CBI, it is difficult. Other parties are taking advantage  of this. In case of HDK it is personal against shiva kumar thru sobha.

Breaking news

ICC has disqualified Australia for ball tampering in yesterday's world cup semifinal match. Bowlers starc and Johnson have been named the culprits. Videos show clearly they tampered it in between the overs.

So this makes India automatically qualify to the finals against New Zealand. We still have a chance to win the cup. 

Thanks to Arnab Goswami and times no channel for submitting the video to ICC. 

Now we can cheer back saying we won't give it back.

🔥A woman's experience with burns ...🔥
    
Some time ago I was cooking some corn and stuck my fork in the boiling water to see if the corn was ready. I missed and my hand went into the boiling water....!!

A friend of mine, who was a Vietnam vet, came into the house, as I was screaming, & asked me if I had some plain old flour... 

I pulled out a bag and he stuck my hand in it. He told me to keep my hand in the flour for 10 minutes. 

He said, In Vietnam , there was a guy on fire and in their panic, they threw a bag of flour all over him to put the fire out...Well, it not only put the fire out, but he never even had a blister!!!!

... Long story short, I put my hand in the bag of flour for 10 mins, pulled it out and did not even have a red mark or a blister & absolutely NO PAIN. 

Now, I keep a bag of flour in the fridge and every time I burn myself. *Cold flour feels even better than room temperature flour.

I use the flour and have never ever had even a red spot/burn mark, or a blister! 

I even burnt my tongue once, put the flour on it for about 10 minutes .... the pain was gone and no burn.

Try it . . . Experience a miracle!  

Keep a bag of flour in your fridge and you will be happy you did!
👌😊😊😊👍☺☺☺✌

Flour has heat absorbant property and also is stong antioxident property. Thus helps in burns patient if apllied within 15 minutes.

15/04/15, 12:28 - Puneeth: What a pleasant Bangalore morning! Not sure if summer is over. But the rains surely did bring some relief 😊
15/04/15, 12:29 - Sugama: 👍
15/04/15, 13:00 - Puneeth: U know what I've started to feel abt Bangalore these days. It rains when it shouldn't. It clogs when it rains. Vehicles r both off the road and on it, sunk into the many potholes that the gov insist to leave the way they r, may b like drishti chukke to shoo off bad spirits (except the gov itself). It brings traffic to a standstill (gives me and Sinchana enough time for each other), and pollution, let's not even start with that. But when i look at it, Bangalore has a huge heart, it welcomes all, embraces them and gives everyone a reason to stay back and love it (a sort of love-hate relationship though). For me, no matter how much I crib of its current sorry state or paint a picture to the immigrants abt it's heydays as a city to retire, at the end of the day, It's just home to me. Where I belong. At least I feel so.
15/04/15, 13:14 - Puneeth: Feeling somewhat nostalgic today.
15/04/15, 13:59 - Sinchana: 👍

18/04/15, 07:00 - Kampa Aunt: Please read this and advise your friends and family! 
You may SAVE others' lives! 
 
Incident One: A little boy died because surgeons found ants in his brain! Apparently this boy fell asleep with some sweets in his mouth or with some sweet stuff beside him. Ants soon got to him and some ants in fact crawled into his ear which somehow managed to go to his brain. When he woke up, he did not realize that ants had gone to his head. After that, he constantly complained about itchiness around his face. His mother brought him to a doctor, but the doctor could not figure out what was wrong with him. He took an X-ray of the boy and to his horror, he found a group of live ants in his skull. Since the ants were still alive, the doctor could not operate on him because the ants were constantly moving around. The boy finally died. So please be careful when leaving food stuff near your bed or when eating in bed. This might attract ants. Most importantly, NEVER you or your child eat sweets before going to bed. You or your child might attract ants while you are asleep. 
 
Incident Two: Another similar incident happened in a hospital in Taiwan . This man was warded in the hospital and was constantly warned by the nurses not to leave food stuff by his bedside because there were ants about. He did not heed their advice. Ants finally got to him. His family members said that the man constantly complained about headaches. He died and a post mortem or autopsy was done on him. Doctors found a group of live ants in his head. Apparently, the ants had been eating bits of his brain. So friends, better be safe than sorry. Never leave food stuff beside your bed you when you go to sleep. IF U Care for Someone......thenfrwrd
 
My request. Pl forward to all groups....

Have you been subjected to the door test yet? The picture test has gone viral. How is it doing so well? It's based on the surprising accuracy the results provide! The task is simple, look at the photos of doors and choose which speaks to you the most. Then coordinate your choice with the explanation and be in awe at the remarkable accuracy.

"If you choose Door #1: 

Your path is freeing. You are the type of person who needs a ton of space. You need the freedom to do things your own way, you prefer a path that you carve yourself, especially one with infinite possibilities and routes. You don’t want to feel constrained and are highly independent, rebellious even, but you don’t like confrontation. You’re more likely to passively resist someone or something. You hate being rushed, and prefer to take the to  time savour life. You’re too busy enjoying life to draw attention to yourself.

If you chose Door #2:

Your path is private. You are the kind of person who prefers to travel alone. You like to observe, think, and sort out whatever is in your head. You prefer a path that’s fit for one. You can see others once you arrive at your destination, but you need your downtime first. You are very original and insightful. You look at the world in a unique way, and others can benefit from your point of view. You are a bit of a loner, but you connect well with people when you take the time. You are very understanding.

If you chose door #3:

Your path is colorful. You are a very engaging and engaged person. You love to be part of the world… you like to experience it all. Your ideal path is filled with colour, excitement and beauty. For you, it’s more about the journey than the destination. You are curious and excited to learn more. You love to start conversations, and you ask lots of questions. You are intellectual and witty. You think of more zingers than you’d ever use, and you keep people laughing 

If you chose door #4:


Your path is exciting! You are always moving forward in life, often into the unknown. You just go for it and deal with the consequences later. Your ideal path is unpredictable and maybe a little scary. You are drawn to the unknown. You can be a rule breaker, and you’re even somewhat careless. You have been known to act without thinking, but it usually all works out for you. You are very spontaneous and a major thrill seeker. You are going to make the most of the time you’ve been given on this planet!

If you chose door #5:

Your path is welcoming. You are a peace-seeking low maintenance person. You are very content, and you don’t like to be bothered. Your ideal path is clear cut and enjoyable. You want to enjoy your trip and to know what you’re getting into. You will often take the easy choice whenever possible. Life is hard enough, and you never want to make it harder on yourself, you are stable and supportive of those around you. You are known for your consistency and down to earth perspective.

If you chose door #6:

Your path is quiet. You value solitude in all aspects of your life. You can spend large periods of time alone without feeling lonely. Your ideal path is one that is very still and quiet. You want to absorb everything around you without feeling overwhelmed. You seek meaning in every aspect of life. You live your life very deliberately- both in action and in thought. You don’t like crowds, but you do like people. You value authentic relationships, and you prefer the depth of one on one interaction."

Then,

H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K ;
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11=98%

K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E ;
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5=96%

L+O+V+E;
12+15+22+5 = 54%

L+U+C+K ;
12+21+3+11 = 47%

None of them makes 100%. Then what makes 100%?

Is it Money? NO!

M+O+N+E+Y= 13+15+14+5+25=72%

Leadership? NO!

L+E+A+D+E+R+S+H+I+P= 12+5+1+4+5+18+19+8+9+16=97%

Every problem has a solution, only if we perhaps change our "ATTITUDE"...

A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E ;
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%

It is therefore OUR ATTITUDE towards Life and Work that makes 
OUR Life 100% Successful.

Amazing mathematics

Beautiful msg to share:
Do you agree that we have 26 alphabets in English, as given below
 
A = 1 ; B = 2 ; C = 3 ; D = 4 ;
E = 5 ; F = 6 ; G = 7 ; H = 8 ;
I = 9 ; J = 10 ; K = 11 ; L = 12 ;
M = 13 ; N = 14 ; O = 15 ; P = 16 ;
Q = 17 ; R = 18 ; S = 19 ; T = 20 ;
U = 21 ; V = 22 ; W = 23 ; X =24 ;
Y = 25 ; Z = 26.

With each alphabet getting a number, in chronological order, as above, study the following, and bring down the total to a single digit and see the result yourself

28/05/15, 07:41 - Kampa Aunt: In Japan, in a soap manufacturing company the soap blocks were made,
then wrapped in a wrapping paper automatically on an assembly conveyer belt
and finally packed in cartons...

Many a times it happened that the wrapping machine wrapped the paper without soap. i.e. you had an empty packet without soap.

To rectify this problem the Japanese company bought a X-ray scanner from the US for $60,000 to check on the  assembly line whether the container contained soap and wasn't empty.  


A similar problem happened at Nirma soaps, in Ahmedabad in INDIA.. Guess what they did????

They bought a bajaj fan costing around Rs.1500/- and placed it on the edge of the assembly line.
The empty wrappers, without soaps just blew away!!! 

😂😂😂

And You Say Japanese are Advanced in Technology.😝😝

We are 
INCREDIBLY
BRILLIANT INDIANS
😂😝😜😆
👌👌👌

29/05/15, 13:36 - Kampa Aunt: This is a REAL Neurological screening Test.Sit comfortably and feel calm.You should be able to complete all 3 tests within 30 seconds or even less.

1. Find the letter C from below.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

2. If you have already found the letter C, now find the digit 6 from below.

999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999969999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999

3. Now find the letter N from below. It's a little more difficult.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMNMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

If you are able to pass this 3 tests, you can cancel your annual visit to your neurologist.Your brain is great and you're far from having Alzheimer Disease.Congratulations!

If you need to relook, that may be an early sign of an aging brain!.

And its not a joke. . . There is c, 6, and N in those crowdy lines.

The ...E... life !!!!!

In this world of E-mails, E-ticket, E-paper, E-recharge, E-transfer...

Never Forget "E-shwar ( God )"

who makes e-verything e-asy for
 e-veryone e-veryday. 
 
"E" is the most Eminent letter
 of the English alphabet.

Men or Women don't exist without "E".

House or Home can't be made without "E".

Bread or Butter can't be found without "E".

"E" is the beginning of "existence" and
 the end of "trouble."

It's not at all in 'war' 
but twice in 'peace'.

It's once in 'hell' but twice in 'heaven'.

"E" represented in 'Emotions' 
Hence,  all emotional relations like Father, Mother, Brother, Sister,wife & friends have 'e' in them.

"E" also represents 'Effort' & 'Energy' 
Hence to be 'Better' from good both "e" 's are added.

Without "e", we would have no love, life, wife, friends or hope

& 'see', 'hear', 'smell', or 'taste' as 'eye' 'ear', 'nose' & 'tongue' are incomplete without "e".

Hence GO with "E" but without 
E-GO.👌

 why you feel proud of being an engineer?

 A  doctor's income increases with increase in diseases / illness.

But an engineer's income increases with increase in prosperity of people and nation ".

Feel proud to be an "Engineer"

My Child

My child isn't my easel to paint,
Nor my diamond to polish!
My child isn't my trophy to flaunt,
Nor my dummy to taunt!
My child isn't my badge or my honour,
Nor my respect that he/she must protect! 
My child isn't an idea or a fantasy,
Nor my reflection or legacy!
My child isn't my puppet or my project,
Nor my pawn or my cadet!

My child is here to fumble & stumble
To get in & out of trouble!
My child is here to try,
To fall & to cry!
My child is here to unravel the mysteries,
To educate oneself & rewrite histories! 
My child is here to make his own choices,
To exercise his freewill & experience the consequences!

As a Parent,
My task is to make my child able & capable,
To keep aside my ego & be by his side!
My task is to guide & educate,
To let be & not frustrate! 
My task is allow him to ponder,
And see my child grow into a Wonder!

Deepak has met her personally and as per him she is really awesome at it. 


 How to inculcate the habit of self study in children!

Many of you want to know how my boys study on their own. So here is a bit though not everything in detail.

1. I had to make up my mind to let go. Since I am a control freak I love to be aware of everything they did. I had to tell myself to let go. Letting go early is v important for their development.
So you need to let go the need to hover in your child’s head all the time.

2. My mom was v happy when she saw my sons studying, eating, playing and fighting on their own. She said a v important thing. “When you were all young, I had no time nor did I know what to teach you all. So I would sit with you all. But that worked well with you as you learnt to study on your own. I see parents who sit and teach 2 to 3 hours daily but the kids are not at all serious.”

So the message is to let your kids study on their own. They will make mistakes and they will falter. It’s ok. Let them do these mistakes when young. The stakes are low. The loss is small. So what they get less marks in class 2 or 5 or 7! Let them realize what is failure early on. They will understand how to do self study. And trust me, in this age of internet, the only reason I am sending my kids to school is because I want them to mingle around with 20 other kids and teachers. Socialize with them . Of course I need peace too. ;).

3. I do not ever ask them what marks they have got. All I ask before assessment is a quick answer to my questions on how will you use this concept in real life. If they know great. Else I give them a bit of Gyan that is enough.

After they come back from tests I don’t ask how much will they get. I ask them this ” So were the questions easy or tough?” If they say it was easy, I know they have understood everything v clearly. If they say it was tough, I know I need to explain it to them as they still have not understood the usage of what ever they learnt and hence it seemed tough to them. It also tells me that I did not explain to them good enough for their smarty heads. So I have to simplify the explanations.

4. I stopped packing their bags when they were in class 3. Their diary notes from teachers would be some thing like this “Mrs Madhurie Singh, your son did not bring his homework book today. Kindly ensure it is there.”

My reply would be this ” Dear teacher, I am teaching him to be responsible. So it is his responsibility to pack all books not mine. Kindly scold him for not getting the book from next time.”
Most teachers have written back this ” Dear Mrs Singh, I appreciate your way of inculcating responsibilities in your son. I will not bother you again for this. Hope more mothers are like you.” And this message is universal!

5. Project work and home assignments are all done by my sons on their own. Initially they would argue with me. ” All my classmates moms help them in their project s and homework. They are neater and look so good. But mine is dirtiest.”
I would tell them the same thing repeatedly till they stopped asking me. “The homework and project work is a way to make you learn and practice what you did in class today. If you do it yourself, you will know how much you understood. If I do it then how will you practice. Do you want to keep on studying the same thing again after today and waste your time? Because if you don’t do your home work and project yourself, you will forget it after today. Then one more day you will have to sit to do it again afresh. That will reduce your playtime.” And I mean what I say.

5. I allow them to mess, waste materials as that is how they learn to use their brains and be creative. I try to teach them in simple conversation about risks, money value, business and importance of being best in whatever they do in life.
Like ask them questions that has nothing to do with their school. E.g. ” I want to hire a Sw Engg, what should I look into that person when I interview him or her?”
Or ” We want to buy a new car, what car should we buy.” The first thing they ask is ” what is your budget?”
My dad wanted to buy toys for them last yr. We all went to Hamleys. My dad asked them ” Boys, what do you want to buy?”
Both asked him ” What is your budget nanaji?” My dad said ” No budget”.
He ended up paying close to 20 thousand for cars, bikes and stationary!
I told my dad. They asked you about the budget, you should have told them the upper limit. And they are v fair.
It's a forward  msg just thought of sharing as it's an eye opener☺️
Hope it teaches us to treat our kids to BE kids😀

16/08/15, 10:58 - Kampa Aunt: DATE WITH A WOMAN…!

Read on..you will be touched too..! 

After 21 years of Marriage, my Wife wanted me to take another Woman
out to Dinner and a Movie.

She said I Love You but I know this other Woman loves you too and would Love
to spend some Time with You.


The other Woman that my Wife wanted me to take out was my MOTHER who has been a Widow for 19 years,
but the demands of my Work and my three Children had made it possible to visit her only occasionally.


That night I called to Invite her to go out for Dinner and a Movie.


'What's wrong, are you well,' she asked?

My Mother is the type of Woman who suspects that a Late Night Call or a Surprise Invitation is a sign of Bad News.


'I thought that it would be pleasant to be with you,'
I responded. 'Just the two of us'


She thought about it for a moment, and then said,
'I would like that very much.'


That Friday after work, as I drove over to pick her up I was a bit Nervous.
When I arrived at her House, I noticed that she too seemed to be Nervous about our Date.

She waited in the Door with her Shawl on.

She had set her Hair and was wearing the Dress that she had worn to Celebrate her last Wedding Anniversary.


She smiled from a face that was as Radiant as an Angel's.


'I told my Friends that I was going to go out with My Son, and they were impressed, '
She said, as she got into the Car.

'They can't wait to hear about our meeting'.

We went to a Restaurant that, although not Elegant, was very Nice and Cozy.

My Mother took my Arm as if She were the First Lady.


After we sat down, I had to read the Menu. Large Print.
Half way through the entries, I lifted my eyes and saw Mom sitting
there staring at me.
A Nostalgic Smile was on her Lips.

'It was I who used to have to Read the Menu when you were young,'

She said.

'Then it's Time that you Relax and let me Return the Favor,'

I responded.

During the Dinner, we had an Agreeable Conversation, nothing
Extra-ordinary, but catching up on recent Events of each others Life.

We talked so much that we missed the Movie.

As we arrived at her House later,

She said, 'I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.'

I agreed.

'How was your Dinner Date?' asked My Wife when I got Home.

'Very Nice. Much more so than I could have Imagined,' I answered.

A few days later, my Mother died of a Massive Heart Attack.

It happened so suddenly that I didn't have Time to do anything for her.
Some time later, I received an Envelope with a Copy of a Restaurant Receipt
From the same place Mother and I had dined.


An Attached Note Said:

'I paid this Bill in Advance.

I wasn't sure that I could be there;

But nevertheless, I paid for Two Plates  
One for You and the Other for Your Wife.

You will never know what that night meant to Me.  

I Love You,  My Son.'

At that moment, I understood the Importance of saying in Time:
'I LOVE YOU!'

and to give our Loved Ones the Time that they Deserve.

Nothing in Life is more important than God, your Family and friends.

Give them the Time they Deserve, because these Things cannot be
Put Off till 'Some Other Time.'

Cute Letter from a newly married girl to her mother

Dear mom,

Like every normal girl, I was excited about marriage right from my childhood days. I never thought beyond the time that I would spend happily with my prince charming.

But today when I am married, I realize that marriage is not all roses. It’s not just about being with your beloved and having a gala time. There is so much more to it. It comes with its own share of responsibilities, duties, sacrifices and compromises.

I can’t wake up anytime I want to. 

I am expected to be up and ready before everyone else in the family. 

I can’t laze around in my pyjamas throughout the day. 

I am expected to be presentable every time. 

I can’t just go out anytime I want to. 

I am expected to be sensitive to the needs of the family. 

I just can’t hit the bed anytime I want to. 

I am expected to be active and around the family. 

I can’t expect to be treated like a princess but am supposed to take care of everyone else in the family.

And then I think to myself, ‘why did I get married at all?’ I was happier with you, mom. Sometimes I think of coming back to you and getting pampered again.

I want to come home to my favourite food cooked by you every evening after a nice outing with friends. I want to sleep on your laps like I have no worry in this world. But then I suddenly realize, had you not got married and made such sacrifices in your life, I wouldn’t have had so many wonderful memories to hang on to. And suddenly, the purpose of all this becomes clear- to return the same comfort, peace and happiness to my new family that I got from you.

And I am sure that as time would pass, I would start loving this life equally as you do. Thank you mom for all the sacrifices and compromises you made. They give me the strength to do the same. Love you.

Someone asked an old man, “At 70yrs, u still call ur wife . …Darling.., jaan…, janu…., sweety…, baby…., Honey….., Luv….!!!!” What is the secret of this love??? 
Dhamaaka answer by Old man: I forgot her name 10 yrs ago…….. & I’m scared to ask her.

😄😷😜😜
Can't beat this😝
21/08/15, 22:38 - Mummy: Guess the original hindi songs try ur brains:

1. . Oh,this night,this season,along the river bank,this playful wind

2. Day is about to end,twilight is on the way,let me go,I have to go

3. I have forgotten my parents place as my beloveds house is lovely.someone please inform my maternal abode about the same

4. what happened to your promise,that vow,that belief? The day my heart forgets you will be the last day of my life

5. now that you have stolen my heart,don’t steal my glance.you have changed my life but don’t change yourself dear

6.Every second this life changes itself.sometimes there is shade,sometimes there is sun

7.  Shall I tell you or shall I keep quiet about the condition of my heart

8. listen sir,the tune of love. I have chosen you, now you too do the same

9.  You please don’t go to your mothers place.don’t go my darling

10.  I want to tell you for the first time; you have brought love,love,love into my life

11. Who is the one coming in my dreams? Who is the one entering my heart? See the sky is also bowing. My love has thus blossomed

12. Where  shd  I  go  without u  ?  Hv not desired  anything  other  than  u  in  this  world 

13.  Why  did  I  love  u  ?  Why  did  I  make my  heart  so  impatient  ? Waited  for  u  mrn  and  evening .......and  day  n  ngt  too

ಕೇಂದ್ರ ಸರ್ಕಾರ 'ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಲಸಿಕಾ ಜ್ಞಾಪನಾ' ಅನ್ನುವ ಯೋಜನೆಯೊಂದನ್ನು ಜಾರಿಗೊಳಿಸಿದ್ದು, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮಗುವಿನ ಹೆಸರು ಮತ್ತು ವಯಸ್ಸಿನ ವಿವರವನ್ನು ಸರ್ಕಾರಕ್ಕೆ ನೀಡಿದರೆ, ಸರ್ಕಾರವೇ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮಗುವಿಗೆ ಕಾಲಕಾಲಕ್ಕೆ ಹಾಕಬೇಕಾದ ಲಸಿಕೆಯ ಕುರಿತು ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮೊಬೈಲ್ ಮೂಲಕ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ನೀಡುತ್ತದೆ.

ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮಗುವಿನ ಹೆಸರು ಮತ್ತು ಹುಟ್ಟಿದ ದಿನಾಂಕವನ್ನು 566778 ನಂ.ಗೆ ಕೆಳಗೆ ಹೇಳಿರುವಂತೆ ಮೆಸೇಜ್ ಮಾಡಿ. ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮಗು 12 ವರ್ಷ ತಲುಪುವವರೆಗೆ ಸರಿಯಾದ ಸಮಯಕ್ಕೆ ಕಡ್ಡಾಯವಾಗಿ ಹಾಕಬೇಕಾದ ಲಸಿಕೆಯ ಕುರಿತು 2 ದಿನಗಳ ಮೊದಲೇ ನಿಮಗೆ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ನೀಡಿ, ನೆನಪಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.

ಮೆಸೇಜ್ ಮಾಡಬೇಕಾದ ವಿಧಾನ:

ಇಮ್ಯುನೈಜ್[ಸ್ಪೇಸ್] ಮಗುವಿನ ಹೆಸರು[ಸ್ಪೇಸ್] ಮಗುವಿನ ಹುಟ್ಟಿದ ದಿನ[ಸ್ಪೇಸ್]


ಉದಾಹರಣೆಗೆ: 
Immunize Ram 01-01-2015


ನೆನಪಿರಲಿ, ಲಸಿಕೆ ಹಾಕಬೇಕಾದ 2 ದಿನಗಳ ಮೊದಲೇ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮೊಬೈಲ್ ಗೆ ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣ ಮಾಹಿತಿಯೊಡನೆ ಸಂದೇಶ ಬರುತ್ತೆ..

12 ವರ್ಷದೊಳಗಿನ ಮಗುವನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುವ ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಬ್ಬ ಪೋಷಕರು ಈ ಯೋಜನೆಗೆ ಹೆಸರು ನೋಂದಾಯಿಸಿ...

10/10/15, 00:56 - Mummy: Today is National Mathematics Day 
(Birth Day of Ramanujam),

See this Absolutely amazing Mathematics !

1 x 8 + 1 = 9
12 x 8 + 2 = 98
123 x 8 + 3 = 987
1234 x 8 + 4 = 9876
12345 x 8 + 5 = 98765
123456 x 8 + 6 = 987654
1234567 x 8 + 7 = 9876543
12345678 x 8 + 8 = 98765432
123456789 x 8 + 9 = 987654321

1 x 9 + 2 = 11
12 x 9 + 3 = 111
123 x 9 + 4 = 1111
1234 x 9 + 5 = 11111
12345 x 9 + 6 = 111111
123456 x 9 + 7 = 1111111
1234567 x 9 + 8 = 11111111
12345678 x 9 + 9 = 111111111
123456789 x 9 +10= 1111111111

9 x 9 + 7 = 88
98 x 9 + 6 = 888

9876543 x 9 + 1 = 88888888
98765432 x 9 + 0 = 888888888

Brilliant, isn't it?

And look at this symmetry :
1 x 1 = 1
11 x 11 = 121
111 x 111 = 12321
1111 x 1111 = 1234321
11111 x 11111 = 123454321
111111 x 111111 = 12345654321
1111111 x 1111111 = 1234567654321
11111111 x 11111111 = 123456787654321
111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321

Brilliant isn't it?

Dad: This is unacceptable. I don't use home phone, I use my work phone.

Mum: Me too. I hardly use home phone. I use my companies phone

Son: I use my office mobile, I never use the home phone.

All of them shocked and together looked at the maid who's patiently listening to them.

Maid: "What? So we all use our work phones. What's the Big deal??

19/10/15, 16:01 - Dimpakka: Do you use Gas for cooking?
Please read this and take note. Let this not happen to you.. This could be a common mistake in any household.
This shocking accident
happend.  A housewife died due to burns sustained in the
kitchen. Her husband too was
hospitalized for injuries due to burns while trying to
rescue his wife.

How it happened:
The gas stove was on and cooking in progress. 
The lady observed some cockroaches near
the sink and grabbed a
can of insect killer and sprayed it near the gas stove, which was on. 
There was an explosion and in no time the poor woman was covered in flames, sustaining 65% burns.

 Her husband rushed in, tried to put out the flames and his clothes too caught fire. 
The husband is still in hospital, in the burns ward, 
still unaware that his wife was declared dead on
arrival. 

Let us understand: - All insect killer sprays such as
"Hit", "Mortein" etc. have highly volatile and inflammable solvents.

The atomized nano spray particles spread very rapidly and one spark is enough to ignite this explosive mixture with oxygen present in air. 

Please educate your family & Friends about this and spread the word around.... 

Don't Keep this msg. in your inbox. 
Please share...
who knows you may save more than a life...

30/10/15, 19:15 - Geethathe: Today when I look back at what I learned during my formidable days of schooling, I see the so called punishments from my beloved teachers as great learning in life, for example :

1. Stand up on the bench - Take a holistic view, look at the big picture
2. Stand with hands up - Aim high, reach higher
3. Stand facing the wall - Introspection
4. Stand outside the class - Learn through observation, take a world view
5. Kneel down - Humility
6. Murga Bano - Physical endurance
7. Clean the blackboard - Forget and forgive, start with a fresh slate
8. Finger on your lips - boast less
9. Hold your ears - listen more
10. Touch your toes - Be flexible
11. Write down a line 25 times - work towards perfection
12. Detained after school - Dont join the rat race...be exclusive.

Perspective matters and thank u to all our teachers.

ಎಕ್ಸಾಮ್ ನ ಹಿಂದಿನ ದಿನ ರಾತ್ರಿ ನಾಲ್ಕು ಜನ
ಗೆಳೆಯರು ಫುಲ್ ಟೈಟ್ ಆಗಿ ಓದದೆ ಹಾಗೆಯೇ
ಮಲಗಿಬಿಟ್ಟರು
ಮರುದಿನ ಎಕ್ಸಾಮ್ ಹಾಲ್ ಗೆ ಹೋಗದೆ ನೇರವಾಗಿ
ಪ್ರಿನ್ಸಿಪಾಲರ ಬಳಿ ಹೋದರು
ಗೆಳೆಯ 1: ಸರ್ ನಿನ್ನೆ ರಾತ್ರಿ ನಾವು
ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನದಿಂದ ಬರುವಾಗ ನಮ್ಮ ಕಾರ್ ಪಂಚರ್
ಆಗಿ ನಾವು ರಾತ್ರಿಯೆಲ್ಲ ಕಾರ್ ನ ತಳ್ಳಿ ಕೊಂಡು
ಬಂದ ಕಾರಣ ಈಗ ನಾವು ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಬರೆಯಲು
ಸಿದ್ಧರಿಲ್ಲ, ,ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ನಮಗೆ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ದಿನ
ಅವಕಾಶ ಕೊಡಿ.
ಪ್ರಿನ್ಸಿಪಾಲ್ : ಸರಿ ನಿಮಗೆ ನಾಡಿದ್ದು ಎಕ್ಸಾಮ್
ಇರತ್ತೆ ಓದ್ಕೊಂಡ್ ಬನ್ನಿ.
ಎರಡು ದಿನಗಳಿಂದ ಹುಡುಗ್ರು ತುಂಬಾ
ಓದಿಕೊಂಡು ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗೆ ಬಂದರು, ನಾಲ್ಕು
ಗೆಳೆಯರನ್ನು ನಾಲ್ಕು ಪ್ರತ್ಯೇಕವಾದ
ಕೋಣೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕೂರಿಸಲಾಗಿತ್ತು. ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ ಪತ್ರಿಕೆ
ನೋಡಿ ಹುಡುಗ್ರು ಕಕ್ಕಾಬಿಕ್ಕಿಯಾದರು
 ಅದರಲಿದ್ದದ್ದು ಕೇವಲ ಒಂದೇ ಪ್ರೆಶ್ನೆ ...
1).ಮೊನ್ನೆ ಎಕ್ಸಾಮ್ ನ ಹಿಂದಿನ ರಾತ್ರಿ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕಾರ್
ನ ಯಾವ ಚಕ್ರ ಪಂಚರ್ ಆಗಿತ್ತು???
A) ಮುಂದಿನ ಎಡ
B) ಮುಂದಿನ ಬಲ
C) ಹಿಂದಿನ ಎಡ
D) ಹಿಂದಿನ ಬಲ

ವಿ.ಸೂಚನೆ: ನಿಮ್ಮ ನಾಲ್ಕು ಜನರ ಉತ್ತರ ಒಂದೇ
ಆದರೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ನೀವು ಪಾಸ್..😉

If you follow many women u remain Salman khan (bachelor)... If you don't follow women u become Narendra modi... Beware do not follow woman  blindly...else u become Manmohan singh... If u keep on thinking who to follow.... Sorry... U will remain a kid like Rahul Gandhi.... 😝😝

And the latest..........without following quietly what your wife says and reveal in public then you will become Aamir Khan

28/12/15, 13:22 - Dimpakka: YOUR PHONE NUMBER. WILL REVEAL YOUR AGE.

 AMAZING -AMAZING-AMAZING

 Your Phone nugmber will reveal your actual Age.
I do not know who discovered this?
         but it is...Really accurate.
 
It will take about 15 seconds,
read and do it at the same time so that you will not lose the fun.
 
1- Take a look at your last digit of your cell phone number
 
2- Use this figure and multiply by 2
 
3- Then add 5
 
4- And then multiply by 50
 
5-And then add the number 1765
 
6- The last step; with this number, subtract your birth year.
 
          Now you see a three-digits   number.
 
The first digit is the last digit of your phone number, the next two digits are your actual age!
                    IS'NT THIS SURPRISING? 
                
                               Try it...
                   Really amazing.
28/12/15, 13:27 - Baava: Wow. I am just 25

If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone – but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken.

Provided there is no air resistance.  He had difficulty  explaining it. Four centuries later with the current technology it has been experimently demonstrated. Its visual treat to watch the video.

18/02/16, 15:05 - Geethathe: “Being a good mom doesn’t have to look a certain way”-Jenny Layton

1. To all the working moms - who is doing a full-time job to provide more than the basic necessities of life for your kid; managing the household; parenting their kids; being independent; and never giving a damn about someone asking “Do you have to work leaving your kids behind?”. Hats off to you!
2. To all the stay at home moms - who chose to stay at home to be a guiding force in the kid’s life; giving up her dreams; running tighter budgets; missing adult interaction; and never giving a damn about someone asking “What do you do all day at home?”. Hats of to you!
3. To all the moms who have not lost their mommy weight; who doesn’t mind being an emotional eater and never giving a damn about someone saying “I am surprised you still haven't lost that baby weight”. Hats off to you!
4. To all the moms with sink full of dishes, a dirty kitchen counter and deicides to take a break with her friends. It doesn’t make you a bad mother. Of course, you deserve a break whenever you feel like. Hats off to you!
5. To all the moms who is multitasking all through the day, and waking up the next day to do it all over again. Hats off to you!
To all the moms who is trying to be polite (inspite of all that hormones and sleepless nights), when someone says “your baby is so tiny!”, “your baby is so huge”. Hats off to you!
6. To all the moms who has to hear someone saying “the baby looks nothing like you!”. Hats off to you!

Being a young and scared mom, you need someone to tell you that you are doing an amazing job. Instead you always hear people saying the wrong things. But, you chose what you do because of your own reasons. You believe that in the long run, your sacrifices are in the best interest of the family. You mask your personal interests; you let them take a back seat or even let it vanish for a greater good. A big hats off to you!

Please, don't give a damn about what others say.

"The less you respond to negativity, the more peaceful your life becomes".

Happy Muming!😍😘

VERY IMPORTANT: ☝
Max Temperatures recorded in some Indian cities:

☀Lucknow 47 degrees
☀Delhi 47 degrees
☀Agra 45 degrees
☀Nagpur 49 degrees
☀Kota 48 degrees
☀Hyderabad 45 degrees
☀Pune 42 degrees
☀Ahmedabad 46 degrees
☀ Mumbai 42 degrees
☀ Nashik 40 degrees 
☀Bangalore 40 degrees
☀ Chennai 45 degrees

Next years these cities will cross 50 degrees. Even AC or fan will not save you in summer.. 😰

Why is it so hot ???
☀☀☀☀☀☀☀☀☀
In last 10 years over 10 crore trees were cut for widening roads and highways. 
🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳 
But not more than a lakh trees has been planted by govt. or public.

How to make India cool ???
☔☔☔☔☔☔☔☔☔

Please do not wait for government to plant trees. 

Sowing seeds or planting trees does not cost much.
🌳🌲🌴🌿🍂🍃🌳🌴🌲🌳
Just collect seeds of Shatavari, Bel, Peeple, Tulsi, mango, Lemon, Jamun, Neem, Custard Apple, Jack fruit, etc.
🍎🍏🍊🍋🍒🍇🍐🍍🍈🍑
Then dig two-three inch hole on open spaces, roadside, footpaths, highways, gardens and also in your society or bungalow. 

Bury these seeds in each hole with soil and then water them every two days in summer.
🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿
In rainy season no need to water them. 

After 15 to 30 days small plants will be born.  
🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱

Patient : 
Does that mean it has space for more whisky ? 

This is called...
- Positive Thinking..
😄😄😄


Lady to her dietician :- What l am worried about is my height and not my weight.

Doc :- How come???

Lady :- According to my weight, my height should be 7.8 feet... 😜

Now this is called positive attitude.. 👍👍


 Self Confidence at its Peak👉

A Man wrote to SBI (India's largest lender)

"My Cheque was returned with remark 'Insufficient funds'. I want to know whether it refers to mine or the Bank".

23/03/16, 22:59 - Sinchana: Bengaluru Special  

*If you throw a stone 
randomly in Bangalore,
chances are, 
it will hit a dog or a
software engineer. 
While the dog may or 
may not have a strap  
around his neck, 
the software engineer 
will definitely have one. 

*In India we drive on 
the left of the road.
In Bangalore, we drive on 
what is left of the road

*Q: What is the 
easiest way of 
causing traffic
accidents in Bangalore?
A: Follow the traffic rules.

* "A guy who was
hunting 
house in Bangalore. 
Meets old lady who 
is potential landlord. 
Conversation goes thus:
Old lady: 
Where do you work, son?
Guy : I work in Infosys.
Old lady: Oh, 
that bus company! Sorry, 
we rent only to 
good IT people.
It would appear that 
Infosys operates 
more buses 
than BMTC in Bangalore"

* Bangalore, where
PG(Paying Guest) is 
the first business 
and IT, the second.

* When someone says
Its raining in Bangalore, 
be sure to ask them 
which area,
which lane and 
which road.

* If a Bangalorean stops 
at a traffic light, 
others behind him 
stop too because 
The others
conclude that 
he has spotted a 
policeman that they 
themselves have not.

*bangalore is the 
only city where 
distance is
measured in 
units of time.

*Rickhsaw driver, 
grocery seller and
common shop keeper 
thinks that you earn 
atleast 1 lakh p/month 
if you are in IT sector.

* Out of every 100 software engineers in Bangalore, 
90 are utterly frustrated 
and  rest have a gf/bf.

* Bus drivers use horns instead of  brakes

* I quote : Bangalore: 
The City where more people know Java than kannada".

* Universal answer in Bangalore is 
"Adjust maadi" 

Power cuts are the only time the whole family assembles together and members speak to each other. Seeing this, BESCOM has decided to have a tagline called "Connecting people by disconnecting power"

PASHA bhai's one leg had turned blue..
He went to the doctor..

Doctor: "poison has spread pasha bhai. The leg needs to be amputated.."

Operation took place and pasha bhai's one leg was removed.

After few days, another leg turned blue.

Doctor: "poison has widely spread. We need to amputate this leg too.."

Now pasha bhai had two artificial legs fixed.

After few days, artificial leg turned blue too..

Doctor: now I understand your problem. Pasha bhai, your lungi is leaving color...😁😂😝

Dhoni: Virat, let’s discuss the semifinals.

Kohli: Yes sir!

Dhoni: So let me come to the point straight, our root cause analysis found out that you are responsible for the defeat in this match.

Dhoni and Kohli discussing it as cricketers

Kohli: What ********** how ????

Dhoni: Team was looking up to you and you had to bowl 6 balls with West Indies needing 8 runs, you could have easily defended it, but you let the team down.

Kohli: This is terrible! I tried my best.

Dhoni: Yes, I do understand, but take it positively and try and improve things.

Kohli: What?? I am not a bowler. Did you notice my score in this tournament?

Dhoni: We know that you are batsman and you scored runs, but that is what is expected from a batsman. As a team player, sometime you need to shoulder more responsibilities. Don’t you think it is fair expectation considering you are looking for next level role?

Kohli: I need some time to think on how to react.

Dhoni: Yes, take time and come up with a positive improvement plan.

Kohli: Any analysis on those two guys who bowled no-balls?

Dhoni: Let’s not bring this kind of environment in a team where we blame each others.

12/04/16, 11:33 - Mummy: ತಾಳ್ಮೆಯಿಂದ ಓದಿ .......👌



ಪುಟ್ಟ ಹುಡ್ಗಿ ತನ್ನ ಎರಡು ಕೈಯಲ್ಲಿ ಎರಡು ಸೇಬುಗಳನ್ನು ಹಿಡಿದುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಳು.
 
ಅವಳ ಅಮ್ಮ ಒಳಗಿಂದ ಬಂದು ನಗುತ್ತಾ ಕೇಳಿದಳು — ಹೇ ಪುಟ್ಟಾ, ನಿನ್ನ ಅಮ್ಮಂಗೆ ನಿನ್ನ ಕೈಲಿರುವ ಒಂದು ಸೇಬನ್ನು ಕೊಡುತ್ತೀಯಾ?
 
ಪುಟಾಣಿ ತಲೆ ಎತ್ತಿ ಕೆಲವು ಸೆಕೆಂಡುಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಅಮ್ಮನ ಮುಖವನ್ನು ನೋಡಿದಳು.ಆಮೇಲೆ ತಕ್ಷಣ ಒಂದು ಸೇಬನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ಪುಟ್ಟ ಬಾಯಿಯಿಂದ ಕಚ್ಚಿ ತಿಂದಳು. ಅದಾದ ಮೇಲೆ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸೇಬನ್ನು ಕಚ್ಚಿ ತಿಂದಳು.
       
ಅದನ್ನು ನೋಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಅಮ್ಮನ ಮುಖ ಸಣ್ಣದಾಯಿತು.ಆದರೆ ತನ್ನ ನಿರಾಶೆಯನ್ನು ತೋರಿಸಬಾರದೆಂದು ಕಷ್ಟ ಪಟ್ಟು ನಗುವನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ಮುಖದಲ್ಲಿ ಉಳಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಳು.

ಆಗ ಪುಟಾಣಿ ಒಂದು ಸೇಬನ್ನು ಅಮ್ಮನ ಕೈಗಿಡುತ್ತಾ ಹೇಳಿತು —ಅಮ್ಮಾ ತಗೋ ಈ ಸೇಬು. ಇದು ತುಂಬಾ ಸಿಹಿ ಇದೆ,ತಿನ್ನು .
   
 ಅಮ್ಮನ ಕಣ್ಣಲ್ಲಿ ನೀರು ಬಂತು.


   — ಎಷ್ಟು ದೊಡ್ಡೋರಾದ್ರೂ, ಎಷ್ಟೇ ತಿಳ್ಕೊಂಡಿದ್ರೂ ಅವಸರದ ನಿಧಾ೯ರ ಒಳ್ಳೇದಲ್ಲ. ಎದುರಿಗಿರುವವರು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದನ್ನು ಕೇಳುವಷ್ಟು ತಾಳ್ಮೆ ಇರಲಿ.

21/04/16, 13:54 - Kampa Aunt: A friend of ours became very sick after drinking water left in a car overnight and she was ill for a couple of months.
No matter how many times you get this E-mail,
Please send it on!!!! 
Bottled water in your car is very dangerous!
On the Ellen show, Sheryl Crow said that this is what
caused her breast cancer.
It has been identified as the most common cause of the high levels of dioxin in breast cancer tissue.. 

Sheryl Crow's oncologist told her: women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. 
The heat reacts with the chemicals in the plastic of the bottle which releases dioxin into the water. Dioxin is a toxin increasingly found in breast cancer tissue.
So please be careful and do not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. 

Pass this on to all the women in your life. This information is the kind we need to know that just might save us! 
Use a stainless steel canteen or a glass bottle instead of plastic! 

LET EVERYONE WHO HAS A WIFE / /DAUGHTER KNOW PLEASE! (This was new to me ) This information is also being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center ... 
No plastic containers in microwaves. 
No plastic water bottles in freezers. 
No plastic wrap in microwaves. 

Dioxin chemical causes cancer, especially breast cancer. 
Dioxins are highly poisonous to cells in our bodies. 
Don't freeze plastic bottles with water in them as this releases dioxins from the plastic. 
Recently the Wellness Program Manager at Castle Hospital , was on a TV program to explain this health hazard. 
He talked about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating food in the microwave using plastic containers...... 
This especially applies to foods that contain fat. 
He said that the combination of fat, high heat and plastic releases dioxin
into the food. 

Instead, he recommends using glass, such as Pyrex or ceramic containers for heating food... You get the same result, but without the dioxin.. 
So, such things as TV dinners, instant soups, etc., should be removed from their containers and heated in something else.
Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. It's safer to use tempered glass, such as Pyrex, etc. 
He reminded us that a while ago some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the styrene foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem is one of the reasons.... 
Also, he pointed out that plastic wrap, such as Cling film, is just as dangerous when placed over foods to be cooked in the microwave. 
As the food is nuked, the high heat causes poisonous toxins to actually melt out of the plastic wrap and drip into the food.. 
Cover food with a paper towel instead.
This is an article that should be sent

24/04/16, 11:17 - Mummy: ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿಂದಿನವರು ಮಕ್ಕಳಾಟಗಳಲ್ಲೂ ಸಹ ಎಷ್ಟು ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿ ರಾಮಾಯಣದ, ಮಹಾಭಾರತದ ಕತೆಗಳನ್ನು ಜೋಡಿಸಿ ಹೆಣೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು... 

ಅಂಥಹ ಒಂದು ರಾಮಾಯಣದ ಕಥೆಯ ನಿರೂಪಣೆ ಈ ಮೇಲಿನ ಆಟದಲ್ಲಿದೆ.... 
ಅದು ಹೇಗೇ ?  👇👇ನೋಡಿ... 

"ಕಣ್ಣಾ ಮುಚ್ಚೆ " - 
ಅಂದರೆ ಅಯೋಧ್ಯೆಯ ಮಹಾರಾಜ "ದಶರಥ" ಕಣ್ಣು ಮುಚ್ಚಲು.... 


"ಕಾಡೇ ಗೂಡೆ "-
 ಶ್ರೀರಾಮಚಂದ್ರನಿಗೆ ಕಾಡೇ ಮನೆಯಾಯಿತು... 

"ಉದ್ದಿನಮೂಟೆ" - 
ಅಹಂಕಾರದಿಂದ ಉದ್ದಿನ ಬೇಳೆಯಂತೆ (ಮೂಟೆಯಂತೆ) ಉಬ್ಬಿಹೋಗಿದ್ದ ರಾವಣನನ್ನು ...

"ಉರುಳೇ ಹೋಯ್ತು" -
ಯುದ್ಧದಲ್ಲಿ ರಾಮ ಹೊಡೆದು ನೆಲಕ್ಕುರುಳಿಸಿದ.... ಅದೆ ಸೊಕ್ಕಿನ ಮೂಟೆ, ಅದೇ ಉದ್ದಿನ ಮೂಟೆ ಉರುಳೇ ಹೋಯ್ತು.... 

"ನಮ್ಮಯ ಹಕ್ಕಿ, ನಿಮ್ಮಯ ಹಕ್ಕಿ ಬಿಟ್ಟೇ ಬಿಟ್ಟೆ ".... 

ಸಾತ್ವಿಕನಾದ ವಿಭೀಷಣ  (ರಾವಣನ ತಮ್ಮ ) ಸೀತೆಯನ್ನು ಗೌರವಾಧರಗಳಿಂದ ತಂದು ಶ್ರೀರಾಮನಿಗೊಪ್ಪಿಸಿದ...

ರಾವಣ ತಿಳಿದಂತೆ ಇದು ನಮ್ಮ ಹಕ್ಕಿ ಅಲ್ಲ , ನಿಮ್ಮಯ ಹಕ್ಕಿ  
ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಕಳಿಸಿಕೊಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇವೆ ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸಿ, ಎಂದು ರಾಮ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಣರನ್ನು ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥಿಸಿದ...

ಈ ಅರ್ಥದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಡೀ ರಾಮಾಯಣದ ಕಥೆಯನ್ನು ಈ ಮಕ್ಕಳಾಟದಲ್ಲಿ ಪೋಣಿಸಿದವರು ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿಂದಿನ ತಲೆಮಾರಿನವರು....

ಹೀಗಿದೆ ನೋಡಿ ಅರ್ಥ ಈ "ಕಣ್ಣಾಮುಚ್ಚಾಲೆ" ಆಟಕ್ಕೆ....

Her husband said: The cat just died.
She burst into tears and said: How could you be so blunt? Why couldn't you have broken the news gradually! Today, you could have said that it was playing on the roof; tomorrow, you could have said that it fell off and had broken its leg; then on the third day, you could have said that the poor thing had passed away in the night. You could have been more sensitive about the whole thing. By the way, how is my mom?
Husband: She is playing on the roof.

06/05/16, 09:49 - Kampa Aunt: Cholesterol is finally officially removed from Naughty List ?? 
 
The US government has finally accepted that cholesterol is not a 'nutrient of concern', doing a U-turn on their warnings to us to stay away from high-cholesterol foods since the 1970s to avoid heart disease and clogged arteries.
 
This  means eggs, butter, full-fat dairy products, nuts, coconut oil and meat have now been classified as "safe" and have been officially removed from the "nutrients of concern" list.
 
The US Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for updating the guidelines every five years, stated in its findings for 2015: "Previously, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that cholesterol intake be limited to no more than 300 mg/day.
 
"The 2015 DGAC will not bring forward this recommendation because available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum (blood) cholesterol, consistent with the AHA/ACC (American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology)
 
The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee will, in response, no longer warn people against eating high-cholesterol foods and will instead focus on sugar as the main substance of dietary concern.
 

US cardiologist Dr Steven Nissen said: "It's the right decision. We got the dietary guidelines wrong. They've been wrong for decades."
 
"When we eat more foods rich in this compound, our bodies make less. If we deprive ourselves of foods high in cholesterol - such as eggs, butter, and liver - our body revs up .

The Real Truth about Cholesterol

The majority of the cholesterol in you is produced by your liver. Your brain is primarily made up from cholesterol.  It is essential for nerve cells to function. Cholesterol is the basis for the creation of all the steroid hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, and corticosteroids.  High cholesterol in the body is a clear indication
which shows the liver of the individual is in good health.

Dr. George V. Mann M.D. associate director of the Framingham study for the  incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors states: "Saturated fats and cholesterol in the diet are not the cause of coronary heart disease. That myth is the greatest deception of the century, perhaps of any century" 

Cholesterol is the biggest medical scam of all time.

There is no such thing as bad Cholesterol!  

So you can stop trying to change your Cholesterol level. Studies prove beyond a doubt, cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease and it won't stop a heart attack.  The majority of people that have heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels.   

OUR BODY NEEDS 950 mg OF CHOLESTEROL FOR DAILY METABOLISM AND  THE LIVER IS THE MAIN PRODUCER. 

ONLY 15% OF CHOLESTEROL IS BEING  DONATED BY THE FOOD WE EAT.  If the fat content is less in our food we eat, our liver
Got to work more to maintain the level at 950 mg.  If the cholesterol level is high in our body, it shows the liver is working perfect.  

Experts say that there is nothing like LDL or HDL. 
…………..
…..  Cholesterol is not found to create block any where in human body. 
Please post the recent facts about CHOLESTEROL
 Would request views on above esp from any Doctor in the group

.................It was their anniversary, and Aarthi was waiting for her husband Rajiv to show up after office in the evening.

Things had changed since their marriage a few years ago, the once cute couple couldn't-live-without-each-other all these years, had turned bitter quarreling for petty issues and stopped talking, living under one roof as strangers.

Fighting over every little thing, both didn't like the way things had changed and Aarthi was waiting to see if Rajiv remembered as it was their anniversary today !!!!!!!

Just as the door bell rang...............she ran to find her husband drenched in rain and smiling with a bunch of flowers in his hand.

The two started to mend and re-live the old days. Making up for fights, then was d plan for champagne, light music as it's raining  !! It was perfect.

But the moment paused when the phone rang..........

Aarthi went to pick it up and it was a man on otherside "Hello ma'am I'm calling from the police station. Is this Mr Rajiv Mehra's number?"

"Yes it is!"

"I'm sorry ma'am; but there was an accident and a man died".

We got this number from his wallet; we need you to come and identify his body."

Aarthi's heart sank.!!! She was shocked!

She said, But my husband is here with me?"

"Sorry ma'am, but the incident took place at 4 pm, when he was boarding the train."

Aarthi was about to lose her conscience.

How could this happen??? !!!!!!!

She had heard about the soul of the person coming to meet a loved one before it leaves !!!!!!

She ran into the other room with tears in her eyes.

He was not there. It was true !!!!!!!!  had he left her for good  ????? !!!!!

Oh God !!! She would have died for another chance to mend with him for every little fight they fought !!!! 

She cried and fell on the floor in pain. She lost her chance !!! Forever !!!!

Suddenly there was a noise from the bathroom, the door opened and Rajiv came out and said "Darling, I forgot to tell you that, my wallet got stolen today while coming in the train"...........on hearing this her heart cried for him and tears rolled down her face with happiness for being alive.

LIFE MIGHT NOT GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE. SO NEVER WASTE A MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN STILL MAKE UP FOR YOUR WRONGS!!!

Let's start making amends.

To parents

To siblings

To relatives

To friends

And many more..........

No one has a promised tomorrow.

Have a wonderful Life with no regrets!

Have a wonderful day....enjoy every single moment from now on....keep smiling 😉😊

The woman walked up to the examiner and said, "I've answered this question in all four ways, wall, cliff, young man, old man. Yet I failed all the four times. How is this possible? What am I supposed to hit ????"

26/05/16, 06:39 - Arpith: Worth reading.... We are living in this awesome Bengaluru someone in Marathahalli, someone in Domlur and some other in Basvangudi but have you ever wondered how did these areas got their names? I know that your answer is NO. Let’s know it today. It is interesting.

1.Nagarbhavi

The name literally  means “a well of snakes”. The name is due to the high number of snakes present in the area before it got urbanized. Also, some believe that it is called a “well” because of the surrounding hillocks that are no longer present  due to urbanization.



2.Marathahalli

The area got its name from a fighter aircraft named Marut which was designed and assembled in HAL, which is very close to this area. There are though a few contradicting reports that a Marut once crash landed in this area giving it its name. Halli in Kannada means village.



3.Basavangudi

The name “Basavanagudi” refers to the Bull Temple that is located here. You can find a monolith statue of the Nandi Bull. Basava in Kannada, the local language, means Bull and Gudi means temple. Hence, the name Basavanagudi.



4.Malleswaram/ Malleswara

Located in the north-west of Bangalore, it derives its name from the famous Kaadu Malleshwara temple in this area.



5. BTM layout

BTM is actually an abbreviation for Byrasandra Tavarekere Madiwala. The area for the layout was carved out from these three neighborhoods and hence the name.



6. HSR Layout

HSR is an abbreviation for Hosur Sarjapur Road Layout. A relatively new suburb located in the south-east of Bangalore, the layout, which is built on land reclaimed from the Agara lake, is located between Hosur Road and Sarjapur Road.



7. Rajajinagar

The area was named after Rajagopalachari, the freedom fighter and the last Governor-General of India.



8. Kodigehalli

This place/area was reportedly given as a gift(gift = Koduge in Kannada) by the former King Kempegowda to someone.



9. Madiwala

Madiwala in kannada means a washerman. Years when Bangalore ended in Jayanagar, this area was full of washermen and hence the area got the same name.



10. Sunkadkatte

The area was like a tollgate which was next to Lake and in Kannada Sunka means Tax and Katte mean lake.



11. Seshadripuram

The area was named after the late Diwan of Mysore Seshadri Iyer.



12. Domlur

Mosquitoes are called Domalu in Telugu. Since the area was notorious for its mosquito population, it is named as Domlur [Doma + ooru which translates to Mosquito Village]



13. Doddanekundi

Not that it is the back part of Elephant. The area was again dominated by Telugu origin where it was originally called as Dodda Nakka Vundi which means ‘There’s a big jackal there’ which then became Doddanekundi in the mouth of kannadigas.



14. Ulsoor

The area had a jackfruit orchard. Jackfruit is called Halasu in Kannada. Halasu-ooru (Jackfruit Village) colloquially became Ulsoor.



15. RT Nagar

The area is named after the National anthem writer Rabindranath Tagore

There should be minimum 10 servants to take care of my needs. I should own the costliest car. I should have the costliest diamond.

Business Speech teleprompter: The secret behind Narendra Modi speeches...

Prime Minister  Narendra Modi has been known to prefer giving public address in Hindi, but nowadays he is speaking equally well in English.

The technology that has helped him is a teleprompter which is also frequently used by US President Barack Obama even for short speeches.

Here's how it works: 
A teleprompter usually consists of two mirrors that are semi-transparent, each mounted on a small, thin stand, with each mirror set at a 45 degree angle. The text from the monitor is visible on the mirror for the speaker to read.

At the base of the mirror is a flat LCD monitor, pointed at the ceiling. It displays the words of speech in a large, typically 56 pt to 72 pt, font. Usually an operator controls the speed the speech, who listens to the speaker and follows along. The operator waits, if the speaker pauses, before moving on.

Though the speaker can easily read from the mirror, from the audience side it looks like a clear piece of glass because of the anti-reflective coating that is on it. During his speech, the speaker simply looks from one teleprompter to the other. This gives an impression that he is looking at the audience while giving his speech.

Your Time Will Come!

Kenya is 2 hrs ahead of Nigeria, but it does not mean that Nigeria is slow, or that Kenya is fast. Both countries are working based on their own "Time Zone."

Some one is still single.. Someone got married and 'waited' 10 yrs before having a child, there is another who had a baby within a year of marriage.

Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a good job; and there is another who graduated at 27 and secured an excellent employment immediately!

Someone became CEO at 25 and died at 40 while another became a CEO at 50 and lived to 90 years. 

Everyone works based on their 'Time Zone'.

People can have things worked out only according to their pace. 

Hence, work in your “Time Zone”.

Your colleagues, friends, younger ones might "seem" to go ahead of you. 

Don't envy them, it's their 'Time Zone.' You are in yours!

Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. All things shall work together for your good. 

Remember, you’re not late… 

You’re very much On Time!

One day, Mr. Peters was having lunch at the dining room when vivekananda came along with his tray and sat next to the professor.

The professor said, "Mr Vivekanand , you do not understand. A pig and a bird do not sit together to eat."

Vivekanandji looked at him as a parent would a rude child and calmly replied, "You do not worry professor. I'll fly away," and he went and sat at another table.

Mr. Peters,  reddened with rage, decided to take revenge. 

The next day in Class he posed the following question: "Mr.Vivekanand , if you were walking down the street and found a package, and within was a bag of wisdom and another bag with money, which one would you take ?"

Without hesitating, Vivekanandji responded, "The one with the money, of course."

Mr. Peters , smiling sarcastically said, "I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom."

Swami Vivekanand shrugged and responded, "Each one takes what he doesn't have."

Mr. Peters, by this time was fit to be tied. So great was his anger that he wrote on Swami Vivekanand's exam sheet the word "idiot" and gave it to Swami Vivekanand.

Vivekanandji took the exam sheet and sat down at his desk trying very hard to remain calm while he contemplated his next move.

A  few  minutes later, Swami Vivekanand got up, went to the professor and told him in a dignified polite tone, "Mr. Peters, you signed the sheet, but you did not give me the grade."

_it is mandatory for us to carry the vehicle documents with us all the time when we are driving
-its mandatory for us to produce the docs immediately as demanded by the police , if not produced.. the Police are within their rights to CONFISCATE our vehicle until we produce the docs. we have 15 days to produce the docs.. pay the fine in court and get our vehicle released.

08/07/16, 10:49 - Sinchana: *How to do root cause analysis...*
 😐

A Management lecturer was talking about Quality and it goes like this :

Lecturer : We all know Lord Ram went to spend 14 years in forest and Sita was kidnapped because of a quality issue 😳

Student : How is this anything to do with quality? 😐

Lecturer : Tell me why did Sita go to forest with Ram ?

Student : Because she was his wife and respected his every decision. 😒

Lecturer : OK but why did Ram go to forest ?

Student : Because his father Dasharatha told him to do so and he never denied his father. 😒

Lecturer : OK why did Dasharatha send his son to forest ?

Student : Dasharatha offered his wife (Kaikeyi) two boons , and she chose to make use of them in the future. And she wanted her son to be King, so on the day of Rama's crowning, she asked Dasharatha to send Rama to exile reminding him of his promised boons. 😏

Lecturer : So why did Dasharatha offer his wife two boons ?

Student : Because during a military campaign against Sambarasura, the wheel of Dasharatha's chariot broke and Sambarasura's arrow pierced the King's armor. She nursed the wounded King back to health. Touched by her courage and timely service, Dasharatha offered her two boons. 😟

Lecturer : Hence Proved. The quality of Chariot's wheel was not upto the mark thus leading to kidnapping of Sita...!!!! 😳

😂😂😂😄😄😜😜😜
So the Quality is very important and if the quality of Chariot's wheel was good, the Ramayana wouldn't have happened 🤔😜🤒

*Bhishma & Advani:* Never crowned. Got respect & yet became helpless at the end of their lives.

*Arjun & Narendra Modi:* Both talented. Reached the highest position due to being on the side of dharma. But realise how difficult it is to follow and practice.

*Karna & Manmohan Singh*: Both intelligent. But never reached anywhere being on the side of adharma.

*Shakuni & Kejriwal:* Both never fought a war, just played dirty tricks.

*Dhritrashtra & Sonia*: Both were blind for love of their sons.

*Krishna and Abdul Kalam*: We celebrate both of them but do not follow what they taught and preached.

*This is Mahabharat and Mera Bharat.*

07/08/16, 18:21 - Mummy: ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳು ತವರಿಗ್ಯಾಕೆ ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ?
ಏನನ್ನೂ ಕೊಂಡುಹೋಗಲು
ಬರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.

ಅವರ ಬೇರುಗಳಿಗೆ
ನೀರೆರೆಯಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ
ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳು...
ಅಣ್ಣತಮ್ಮಂದಿರ ಸುಖ
ಸಂತೋಷವನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ
ಆನಂದಿಸಲು ..
ತಮ್ಮ ಮಧುರ ಬಾಲ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹುಡುಕಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ ತವರಿಗೆ
ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳು.

ತವರು ಮನೆಯ ಅಂಗಳದಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ನೇಹದ ದೀಪ ಬೆಳಗಿಸಿಡಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಯಾರ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ದೃಷ್ಟಿಯೂ ಬೀಳದಂತೆ
ಬಾಗಿಲಿಗೆ ರಕ್ಷೆ ಕಟ್ಟಲು
ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಮಮತೆಯ ಝರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ
ಮಿಂದು ಹೋಗಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ತಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿರುವುದೇನನ್ನೋ
ಕೊಟ್ಟುಹೋಗಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ
ತವರಿಗೆ ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳು.

ತಿರುಗಿ ಅತ್ತೆ ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೊರಟಾಗ
ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಅಲ್ಲೇ ಬಿಟ್ಟು
ಹೊರಡುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಎಲ್ಲರ ಮಂಜಾದ ಕಣ್ಣುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ
ತಮ್ಮ ನಸುನಗೆಯನ್ನು
ಈಜಲು ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ಅತೀ ಚಂಚಲ, ಅತಿ ಉತ್ಸಾಹದ
ಚಿಲುಮೆ ಆಗಿರುತ್ತಾಳೆ ಮಗಳು.
ಕೋಮಲ ಮನಸ್ಸಿನ ಮುಗ್ಧ
ಮಗಳು.. ಮಾತು ಮಾತಿಗೂ
ಅಳುವವಳು,...
ದೇವರ ಕೃಪೆಯಿಂದಷ್ಟೇ
ಹುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಾಳವಳು.

ಅವಳ ನಗುವಿಂದಲೇ
ಮನೆ ಸುಗಂಧಿತ..
ಪರರ ಮನೆಗೆ ಕಳುಹಿಸುವಾಗ
ಏನೋ ವಿಚಿತ್ರ ಸಂಕಟ.
ಮನೆ ಭಣಗುಟ್ಟಿಸಿ
ಎಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಅಳಿಸಿ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ
ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.

ತಾಯಿಯ ಪ್ರತಿಬಿಂಬ..
ತಂದೆಯ ಮುದ್ದಿನ 
ಕಣ್ಮಣಿ...
ದೇವರೇ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾನಂತೆ..
ತಾನು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಸಂತೋಷದಿಂದಿರುವಾಗ
ಹುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಾರೆ ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.

06/09/16, 22:36 - Kampa Aunt: *In an investment seminar a man saw a beautiful lady and falls in love instantly,*

*He proposes her, But being a financial planning expert she asks about his background..*

*He said - "..well, I am an ordinary man today, but few months later, after my ailing father dies, I would inherit 300 crore property ...😊"*

*The lady was deeply impressed ...and they exchanged thier business cards...*

*...and within a month the lady walks into his house as his step mother...*😜


*Moral: Investment is subject to market risks...*

07/09/16, 10:03 - Dimpakka: In the jungle which animal is the biggest ........
I heard you say, Elephant.

In the jungle which animal is the tallest ........ 
I heard you say, Giraffe.

In the jungle which animal is the wisest ........
I heard you say, Fox.

In the jungle which animal is the fastest ........ 
I heard you say, Cheetahs.

Among all these wonderful qualities mentioned, where is the Lion in the picture.Yet, you say the Lion is the king of the jungle even without any of these qualities. But, I discovered something fascinating about the Lion.

The Lion is courageous, the Lion is very bold, the Lion is always ready to face any mountain, any challenges, any barrier that crosses his part, no matter how big they are. The Lion walks with confidence. The Lion dares anything and it's never afraid. The Lion believes he is unstoppable. The Lion is a risk taker. The Lion believes any animal is food for him. The Lion believes any opportunity is worth giving a trial and never allows it slip from his hands. The Lion has charisma.

- What is it that we get to learn from here ...

• You don't need to be the fastest.
• You don't need to be the wisest. 
• You don't need to be the smartest.
• You don't need to be the most brilliant.
• You don't need to be generally accepted to become your dreams and be great in life.

• All you need is courage.
• All you need is boldness. 
• All you need is the will to try.
• All you need is the faith to believe it is possible.
• All you need is to believe in yourself that you can do it.😊

09/09/16, 11:05 - Kampa Aunt: *Short Story...Nice Moral..!*

*A person asked a question to his Guru, "My workers are not true to me. My children, my wife and the entire world is very selfish. No body is correct."*

*Guru smiled and told a story...,*

*In one small village there was a room with 1000 mirrors. One small girl used to go inside and play.! Seeing thousands of children around her she was joyful.* 
 
*She would clap her hands and all the 1000 children would clap back at her*

*She considered this place as the world's happiest n beautiful place and would visit often.*

*This same place was once visited by a sad n a depressed person.*

*He saw around him thousands of angry men staring at him*

*He got scared and raised his hands to hit them and in return 1000 hands lifted to hit him back.*
 
*He thought... this is the worst place in the world and left that place.*

*This world is also a room with 1000 mirrors around you... What we let out of us is what the society will give back to us.!!*

*"This world is a heaven... It's up to us what we make out of it..."  said the Guru....* 🙏

You call everybody by title 'Sir'.
You know what is meant by word 'Sir'..?
'Slave I Remain (SIR)'
The British during their rule wanted all Indians to address them as 'Sir'.
Even after 69 years of independence, we still keep calling everyone 'Sir'. 
Even American President is addressed 'Mr. President', not 'Sir'.....!!😎. 
MANY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THE REAL MEANING OF THE WORD AND THINK IT IS AN ADDRESS WITH RESPECT.

Frankly, even i didn't know it

1. Add 1 tbls of fruit jam to a glass of cold milk, blend well and a quick delicious fruit shake is ready for your kids.

2. Add 2 tbls pickle masala, 2 tbls pickle oil and a pinch of salt to a cup of wheat flour to make delicious achari poori's for breakfast and as a travel food.

3. Add 1 tbls leftover pickle masala to regular subzi to make achari aloo, achari bhindi, achari brinjal or any dry curry of your choice.

4. Add kiwi fruit, green apple, oranges, berries or any sour or over-ripe fruit to make coriander chutney more nutritious.

5. While making coriander chutney, add a few nuts of your choice to make it more nutritious and to increase its shelf life.

6. If you have added too much chilli powder in a gravy, then add some curd, lemon juice or 2 t.s ghee to it for balance.

7. If your gulab jamuns turn out hard, don't worry; just put them in the pressure cooker with sugar-syrup and cook for 5 minutes on medium heat and then serve warm with a smile.

8. While making potato chips, mix some alum powder in the water and soak the chips in it before boiling.

9. While grinding red chili powder, add a little mustard oil to it to get a bright red colour.

10. It is much easier to grind small cardamom if you add some sugar to it while grinding.

11. Add 1 tbls gram flour in semolina to make your sooji halwa delicious.

12. While making gravy for a kofta or paneer dish, use milk instead of water for smoother gravy.

13. If asafoetida becomes too hard, then keep a green chilli with it.

14. If you are short of tomatoes to make gravy, then add some tomato ketchup.

15. Add a little Bounvita to coffee for a delicious twist in the taste.

16. Grease leftover dough with some oil or ghee before covering and storing it in the refrigerator.

21. Keep an apple by potatoes. They will stay fresh and will not sprout easily.

22. If facing difficulty in rolling aloo parantha, add some dry roasted gram flour or some bread crumbs to the filling; it will not come out while rolling.

24. Use scissors to chop green chillies and coriander.

25. While boiling potatoes, add some salt or vinegar in the water, to avoid cracking while boiling.

26. Use white tooth powder to clean your silverware and silver jewellery.

28. If your rice gets burnt, don't worry; just put a slice of bread in the pan for 10 minutes. The bread will absorb the burnt flavour.

29. Freeze leftover coffee in an ice tray; and the next time you make cold coffee, use these cubes instead of plain ice cubes.

20/09/16, 12:58 - Dimpakka: Important information for folk's (Ladies & Gents) Useing Microwave In House Or At Office....???
Pl Read It Carefully & Not Miss Out Any Point's.

When was the last time you checked your microwave for radiation leakage? 

Yes, I did say radiation leakage, because any microwave can start leaking radiation any time, for whatever reasons. And such a
leakage is hazardous to humans and pets in the house.

You don't need to call in experts or to send your microwave to the dealer's workshop for a leakage test. That's time consuming,
inconvenient and costly. 

Here's how you can test your microwave for
radiation leakage, right in your own house, at no cost. 

Just follow these simple steps >>>

1.   Switch-off and un-plug the microwave from the electrical socket.
2.   Place your mobile phone inside the microwave and shut the door.
3.   Using another mobile phone, dial the phone that's inside the microwave.
4.   If the outside phone says "the number you are dialling is not reachable, or is out of coverage area, or is switched off; then your
microwave is safe.

5.   But if the phone inside the microwave lights up and rings, your microwave is leaking radiation. Just throw away the damn thing and get a new one. (Believe me, the medical treatment of the side-effects of
radiation leaks is costlier than the price of maybe 10 new microwaves.)

Remember, just because the door of your microwave appears to shut properly does not conclusively mean that it is not leaking radiation.

Stay safe, and test your microwave regularly at frequent intervals; the frequency of testing depending on the extent of usage, and you are the best judge of that.

PLEASE SHARE THIS INVALUABLE INFORMATION WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS & RELATIVES
May be you can do this while buying a new microwave oven

20/09/16, 14:37 - Sinchana: Everyone seems to be in such a hurry to scream 'racism' these days.
In London, a customer asked
,"Do you have "Sarso Da Tel?"
The shopkeeper says "are you a "Sardar"?
The guy, clearly offended, says,"Yes I am...But let me ask you something.
If I had asked for Olive Oil, would you ask me if I was Italian?
Or if I had asked for Bratwurst, would you ask me if I was German?
Or if I asked for a kosher hot dog would you ask me if I was Jewish?
If i had asked for halal meat..wud u ask me if I was Muslim?

Or if I had asked for a Taco, would you ask if I was Mexican?

The shopkeeper says, "No, I probably wouldn't."
The guy says, "Well then, because I asked for Sarso Da Tel, why did you ask if I am a
 Sardar?"
The shopkeeper replied,
"Because, this is a wine shop"
 😂😂😂😂😂

So the doctors checked again with the boy if he had eaten out......The boy said yes.  He had pineapple that evening.  Immediately a group from the hospital went to the pineapple vendor to check.  They find the pineapple seller had a  cut on his finger while cutting the pineapple, his blood had spread into the fruit.            
        When he had his blood checked the guy was suffering from AIDS......but he himself was not aware. Unfortunately the boy is now suffering from it.           Please take care while U eat on the road side. (Particularly tasty VADAPAV  &PANIPURI)and pls fwd this mail to your dear one's...........

21/09/16, 12:34 - Kampa Aunt: An American visited India and went back to America
Where he met his Indian friend who asked him
How did u find my Country
The American said it is a great country
With solid ancient history
And immensely rich with natural resources.

The Indian friend then asked.
How did u find Indians??

Indians??
Which Indians??
I didn't find or meet  a single Indian there in India.

What nonsense??
Who else could u meet in India then??

The American said..

In Kashmir, I met a Kashmiri...
In Punjab a Punjabi,
In Bihar a bihari,
In Karnataka Kannadiga,
in Maharashtra Marathi,
in Rajasthan Marwadi,
in Bengal Bengali,
in TamilNadu Tamilian,
in Kerala Malayali, 
in Telangana Telugu,

Then i met
A Hindu,
A Muslim,
A Sikh
A Christian,
A Jain,
A Buddhist,

And then lots of Jats 
(burning vehicles, vandalising public property, blocking roads & railways, paralysing whole country demanding 'Quota' in Govt jobs under the garb of upliftment. I learnt that it means life-long salary without doing any work. Hence in great demand by all sects & exploited by self-seeking politicians).

And many many many more......
But nøt a single Indian did I mèét ....

EXCEPT

The Indian Army,
The Indian Air Force & 
The Indian Navy.......

...The only identifiable entity. 

Think höw serious this joke is..😒

The day would not be far when indeed we would
Become a collection of polarized states as some
Regional & Parochial anti-national politicians  want...

The Indian Army/Navy/Air Force are the ONLY adhesive holding the geographic entity of India together both in war & peace (collapse of civil adminstration in maintaining law & order/ natural calamities), and despite being slighted & short changed since independence. But for them, India as we know it would have ceased to exist long ago.

Fight back -
Always say you are Indian

You need to chänge öur thinking not just öur pröfile picture. Only then will your Nation change. Jai Hind!

23/09/16, 13:00 - Kampa Aunt: Attachment in Detachment ----- Written by Sudha Murti
🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸
When my daughter, the older of my two, wed and left home, I felt a part of me gone.

With a daughter and a son, I know what both mean, differently.

When she was in her teens I felt as if she was my "physical extension" !

So when she left home to set up her own, I felt I lost a limb.

Next time she came to stay with us, I was astonished how her priorities had changed.

We too must've given the same shocks to our own parents !

When she said Amma,
she meant her mother-in-law, not me!

I felt she was always in a hurry to go back to her house and not stay with me for a few more days.

 That was the first time, it dawned on me that I have to start practising detachment with attachment.

Two years after my daughter’s marriage, my son left for higher studies to US.

Having experienced a child's separation once, I was better equipped emotionally.

I plunged head long into various classes held in the city starting from vedanta to healing to ikebana -
 I just wanted to be away from home..since my husband was a 24/7 workaholic.

My son used to write how he was missing my home cooked food, how he was waiting to come back to live in Chennai with us ...

After a few years, he did come back and we got him married.

He started living separately with his wife and we were also happy that they wanted to be independant from the beginning...

But now, it was all changed !

When in the U S, he missed my cooking, now if I called him to come over with his wife for a meal, it was always some excuse like "oh, amma, we have other plans for the day, please don't mistake us if we don't drop in today" !

I could see that his priorities had also changed completely..

We talk so many things and give so much advice to others, but when it comes to our own children, acceptance comes very late. Our next step is to just leave them undisturbed
in every way.

It was at that time, that I made the following, my 'new profile'.

In all my relationships , rather interactions, I give my best and do my best to live up to what I say.

My attachment with them is complete.

However, I remain detached in the sense that I do not expect them to reciprocate my affection.

Most importantly, I make a conscious effort , not to interfere or pass judgements on the lives they choose to lead.

My concern for my near and dear ones will not fade with my detachment.

If you let go of the ones you love, they will never go away –
this is the beauty of attachment with detachment !

I have learnt to love and let go.

This dictum has developed tolerance in me.

When I let the people live the way they want to, I learn to accept them for what they are.

Most importantly ,
I learn to tolerate the world around me and this tolerance brings in me a sense of peace and contentment.

Since both my children live in Chennai, I follow this very strictly, you know why !

Now I have realised that we start growing mentally much more only after the children leave the house and we have to tackle the emotional vacuum, that arises, along with age-related problems .

I specially dedicate this post to my  friends, who are  totally  dependant  on their  children's lives, to nurture their  own  selves  emotionally.

Please develop your  own  intersts, hobbies  etc, however mundane they  seem to be..

We must learn
To love whatever  we  do
instead of
Doing whatever we love !!

24/09/16, 15:41 - Kampa Aunt: How Income Tax can be abolished and yet make India stronger. 

Read in full the wonderful paper.  

Anil Bokil , one of the key member of Arthakranti Sansthan was given time to share to PM Modi. He was given 9min for sharing but Mr Modi heard him for 2 hrs. The fundamental framework had been patented by the Same than, but I personally feel the Sansthan should gift the proposal to India. 

Arthakranti Proposal

What is Arthakranti Proposal and who has given the proposal?

“Arthakranti Proposal” has been given by a Pune (Maharashtra) based “Arthakranti Sansthan” which is an Economic Advisory body constituted by a group of Chartered Accountants and Engineers. The fundamental framework has been patented by the Sansthan.

Arthakranti Proposal is an effective and guaranteed solution of Black Money Generation, Price rise and Inflation, Corruption, Fiscal Deficit, Unemployment, Ransom, GDP and industrial growth, terrorism and good governance.

What is in the Proposal ?

“Arthakranti Proposal has FIVE point of actions simultaneously.

(1) Scrap all 56 Taxes including income tax excluding import duty.

(2) Recall and scrap high denomination currencies of 1000, 500 and 100 rupees.

(3) All high value transaction to be made only through banking system like cheque, DD, online and electronic.

(4) Fix limit of cash transaction and no taxing on cash transaction.

(5) For Govt. revenue collection introduce single point tax system through banking system – Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) on only Credit Amount

Important Points to note:

(1) As on today total banking transaction is more than 2.7 lakh crores per day say more than 800 lakh crores annually.

(2) Less than 20% transaction is made through banking system as on today and more than 80% transaction made in cash only, which is not traceable.

(3) 78% of Indian population spend less than 20/- rupees daily why they need 1000/- rupee note.

What will happen if All FIFTY SIX Taxes including income tax scrapped :

(1) Salaried people will bring home more money which will increase purchasing power of the family.

(2) All commodities including Petrol, Diesel, FMCG will become cheaper by 35% to 52% .

(3) No question of Tax evasion so no black money generation.

(4) Business sector will get boosted. So self employment.

What will happen if 1000/ 500/ 100 Rupees currency notes recalled and scrapped :

(1) Corruption through cash will stopped 100%.

(2) Black money will be either converted to white or will vanish as billions of 1000/500/100 currency notes hidden in bags without use will become simple pieces of papers.

(3) Unaccounted hidden huge cash is skyrocketing the prices of properties, land, houses, jewellery etc and hard earned money is loosing its value; this trend will stop immediately.

(4) Kidnapping and ransom, “Supari killing” will stop.

(5) Terrorism supported by cash transaction will stop.

(6) Cannot buy high value property in cash showing very less registry prices.

(7) Circulation of “Fake Currency” will stop because fake currency printing for less value notes will not be viable.

What will happen when Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) is implemented :

(1) As on today if BTT is implemented govt can fetch 800 x 2% = 16 lakh crore where as current taxing system is generating less than 14 lakh crore revenue.

(2)When 50% of total transaction will be covered by BTT sizing 2000 to 2500 lakh crores, Govt will need to fix BTT as low as 1% to 0.7% and this will boost again banking transaction many fold.

(3) No separate machinery like income tax department will be needed and tax amount will directly deposited in State/Central/District administration account immediately.

(4) As transaction tax amount will be very less, public will prefer it instead paying huge amount against directly/indirectly FIFTY SIX taxes.

(5) There will be no tax evasion and govt will get huge revenue for development and employment generation.

(6) For any special revenue for special projects, govt can slightly raise BTT say from 1% to 1.2% and this 0.2% increase will generate 4,00,000 crores additional fund.

Effects, if implemented today :

(01)Prices of all things will come down.

(02)Salaried people will get more cash in hand.

(03)Purchasing power of Society will increase.

(04)Demand will boost, so will production and industrialisation and ultimately more employment opportunity for youth.

(05) Surplus revenue to the govt for effective health/ education/ infrastructure/ security/ social works.

(06) Cheaper and easy loans from banks, interest rate will come down.

(07) Tendency of society will changes from scarcity to quantity.

(08) Spare money for political system for clean politics,

(09) Prices of land/ property will come down,

(10) No need to export beef to cover up trade deficit

(11) Sufficient fund for research and development.

(12) Society will be free from “Bad elements”.

A very nice n simple compilation with logical impact. Worth sharing!!

28/09/16, 11:57 - Kampa Aunt: Why young people don't buy cars and apartments anymore

Nowadays, the traditional measure of success — owning an apartment and/or a car — is out of date. An increasing number of young people around the world don’t want to buy them.

Research shows that the so-called millennial generation, who are now 30-35 years old, rarely buy houses and even more rarely — cars. In fact, they don’t buy super expensive things at all. In the USA, people under the age of 35 are called ’the generation of renters.’

Why does this happen?

Some sociologists say it’s because modern youngsters suffer from financial crises. That’s why people are afraid of ’serious’ loans.

But it’s not the most important reason. The thing is, the current generation of young people differs from their parents’ generation. They have other values.

The youth today has reconsidered the concept of success, which means:

Successful people don’t buy property — they rent.If you want to be considered successful, invest in experiences: travel, do extreme sports, build startups.

The point is that people now don’t want prosperity and stability — all they want is flexible schedules and financial and geographical independence.

People have no interest in material things

Why own a car if you can take a cab? It’s almost a personal car with a driver. And it’s not more expensive than having your own car. Why buy a house in a beautiful place and go there for vacation, if you can find a place to stay through Airbnb in any corner of the planet? You don’t have to overpay for rent or buy a property in a country you love. The same thing with real estate in your hometown:

You don’t know how long you’ll stay where you live.You can take on a mortgage for 40 years, or you can accept the fact that you’ll spend your whole life in a rented place.You’ll probably change your job in the next few years. If you rent, nothing prevents you from moving closer to the office.

According to Forbes, modern young people change jobs every three years on average.

The concept of ownership is no longer relevant

James Hamblin, The Atlantic’s columnist, explains the phenomenon as follows: ’Over the past decade, psychologists carried out a great amount of research proving that, in terms of happiness and a sense of well-being, spending money on new experiences is much more profitable than buying new things. It brings more joy.’

Experiences help us make friends

Social interaction between people is crucial to whether they feel happy or not. Talking to others and having a lot of friends makes you a happier person. But would people rather hear about how you spent a year in a wild country or about how many apartments you’ve already bought?

Here’s an extract from Hamblin’s article:

’Turns out people don’t like hearing about other people’s possessions very much, but they do like hearing about that time you saw Vampire Weekend.’

Remember that even a bad experience can become a good story. Material things cannot.

Buying things makes us worry

There’s one more thing. The things we own, especially if they’re very expensive, make us worry about their condition. If you buy a car, you’ll flinch every time someone’s alarm sounds outside. If you buy a house and fill it with expensive items, you’ll be afraid of being robbed. Not to mention the fact that a car can be scratched or break down, and a super expensive TV might break after a year of usage. But no one can ever take away the experiences you have.

Every purchase will go down in price over time

Our parents weren’t able to travel as often as we do. There wasn’t the possibility to have so much fun. They didn’t have so many opportunities to start a new business. Therefore, they invested in houses and cars, and we don’t want to do that. After all, every purchase, if it’s not a house or an apartment, will depreciate over time. And if we think about how quickly real estate depreciates during a crisis, then everything becomes even more obvious.

Experience is the only thing that matters: it won’t go down in price, and no one can steal it.

29/09/16, 10:10 - Kampa Aunt: Once IT Engineer was travelling by train in A/c class.  He was traveling from Konkan to Pune! 

He was traveling alone! 

Some time later, a Beautiful lady came and sat in the opposite berth! 

IT Engineer was pleasantly Happy!

The lady kept smiling at him!  This made IT Engineer even more Happy!

Then she went and sat next to him! 

IT Engineer was bubbling with Joy! 

She then leant towards him and whispered in his ear " Hand over all your valuables, cash, cards, mobile phone to me 
else I will shout and tell everybody that you are  harassing and misbehaving with me" 

IT Engineer stared blankly at her!

He took out a paper and a pen from his bag and wrote " I  can not hear or speak. You write on this paper whatever you want to say" 


The lady wrote everything what she said earlier and gave it to him! 

IT Engineer took her note, kept it in his pocket! 

He got up and told her in clear tones..."Now shout & scream!!"

29/09/16, 11:13 - Kampa Aunt: WHAT AN EYE OPENING STORY
 
There’s a bakery shop near to our house. Often, on my way back home in the evening, I buy some stuff for the morning breakfast. Today, as I was about to leave the bakery, I met our neighbour Mr. Ajay who himself was leaving the same shop. After the exchange of some traditional greetings, the conversation went like following.

I asked: “What have you bought?”
 
Ajay replied: “Nothing much , just some chicken patties and some sweetmeats for my wife and children”.

Jokingly, I enquired, “Why so? Hasn't your wife cooked today?”

He said: “No, it’s not like that. Actually today in office we were a little hungry so my colleagues ordered some patties and sweetmeats. Since, I had this at the office I thought to buy some for my family too. It’s not fair that I eat whatever I like at the office while my kids and wife remain bound to eat whatever is cooked at home.”

Confounded with great surprise, I stared at him because I never thought this way before.

I said: “What’s the big deal, ajay?  If you eat food of your own choice at the office, your wife and children would also be having whatever they like to eat at home.”

Ajay replied: “Not at all,  My wife saves for me from everything there is. Even if someone from neighborhood sends something, my wife first saves some for me and then distributes it among my kids. It would be very selfish if I just enjoy good things with my friends and not with my family.”

Amazed upon hearing this I said: “Enjoying? This bakery stuff is what you think is enjoyment?”

He said: “Whatever ! I dread the time when on the Day of Resurrection I’ll be questioned about this. That I took someone’s daughter into marriage and had fun with my friends while she ate whatever little was available.”

Completely stunned, I couldn’t move my eyes off him while he continued.

“Look, when we get married to someone’s sister or daughter, they are human beings as well. Just like us. They too have hunger needs. They have their desires as well. They too wish to taste lots of delicious foods or foods of their choice, to try different kinds of lovely outfits. They also want to move and travel around. Keeping them caged like a bird, providing them meals twice a day and having a sense of smugness for doing all this is selfishness. And the way we treat the daughters of others is the way our own daughters and sisters will be treated because what goes around comes around.”

His last words shook me to a great degree. I never thought like this before.  Concluding the conversation with Ajay I said, “Great! You have made me think from a different perspective.”

I turned back to the shop.

Ajay: “Where are you going?”

I replied, “To buy some ice-cream…actually I had some ice-cream at the office today.”

Ajay and Myself took their respective paths. Ajay was glad to have a positive impact on me. On the other hand, I now, knew how to keep my wife and kids happy and acknowledge all the efforts my wife does for my happiness.

Wives are what makes life beautiful!👸💁

"No wonder they are called the better half!"
29/09/16, 11:18 - Kampa Aunt: A post on Facebook by Michelle Barrack Obama every couple should read....
HARDCORE TRUTH ABOUT MARRIAGE! !!!!
1. There is nothing that threatens the security of a wife than the thought of another woman competing for the attention and affection of her husband. Nothing is more painful. Nothing is more disrespecting. Nothing is more insulting. Nothing is more belittling and degrading.
2. Marriage flourishes when the couple works together as a team; when both husband and wife decide that winning together is more important than keeping score.
Good marriages don't just happen. They are a product of hard work.
3. Your children are watching you and forming lasting opinions on love, commitment, and marriage based on what they see in you. Give them hope. Make them look forward to marriage.
4. Husbands: The reason why other women look attractive is because someone is taking good care of them. Grass is always green where it is watered. Instead of drooling over the green grass on the other side of the fence, work on yours and water it regularly. Any man can admire a beautiful woman, but it takes a true gentleman to make a woman admirable and beautiful.
5. When a husband puts his wife first above everyone and everything except God, it gives his wife the sense of security and honor that every wife hungers for.
6. A successful marriage doesn't require a big house, a prefect spouse, a million dollars or an expensive car. You can have all the above and still have a miserable marriage. A successful marriage requires honesty, undying commitment and selfless love and Jesus at the center of it all.
7. Pray for your spouse every day; in the morning, in the afternoon and at evening. Don’t wait until there is a problem. Don’t wait until there is an affair. Don’t wait until something bad happens. Don’t wait until your spouse is tempted. Shield your spouse with prayer and cover your marriage with the fence of prayer.
8. The people you surround yourself with have a lot of influence on your marriage. Friends can build or break your marriage; choose them wisely.
9. One spouse cannot build a marriage alone when the other spouse is committed to destroying it. Marriage works when both husband and wife work together as a team to build their marriage.
10. Don't take your spouse for granted. Don't take advantage of your spouse's meekness and goodness. Don't mistake your spouse's loyalty for desperation. Don't misuse or abuse yours spouse's trust. You may end up regretting after losing someone that meant so much to you.
11. Beware of marital advice from single people. Regardless of how sincere their advice may be, most of it is theoretical and not derived from real life experiences. If you really need Godly advice, seek it from God-fearing, impartial and prayerful mature couples whose resolve has been tested by time and shaped by trials.
12. Dear wife, Don't underestimate the power of the tongue on your marriage. The tongue has the power to crush your marriage or build it up. Don't let the Devil use your tongue to kill your spouse's image, self-confidence and aspirations. Let God use your tongue to build up your marriage and bless and praise your spouse.

06/10/16, 10:37 - Sinchana: This year's Nobel prize for medicine has gone to a Japanese scientist Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi for his research on autophagy. Autophagy means to "self eat". In other words, the process by which the human body eats it own damaged cells and unused proteins. Autophagy is a natural process and also one which occurs in cases of starvation. The failure of autophagy is one of the main reasons for accumulation of damaged cells which eventually leads to various diseases in the body. Autophagy is important to prevent/fight cancer and also plays a vital role in degrading and 'consuming' cells infected by bacteria and viruses.

I have to observe here that ancient India had recommended a practice of fasting (Ekadasi) one day in a fortnight. Many of us religiously follow this practice to this day as a penance for spiritual progress without any idea of the biological and therapeutic benefits of this practice. Through this process of fasting induced autophagy, our body repaired its damaged and degenerated cells or used up the proteins of the damaged cells for its survival.

Whenever modern science conquers a frontier in any field, it somehow relates back to a quaint spiritual practice followed in India for generations.

A day in a fortnight spent in prayer and divine contemplation was a tonic for the mind and soul while the practice of fasting ensured that the body would heal and rejuvenate itself.

Clearly, our ancients believed in a process of holistic healing of both the body and the mind.  They were able to, quite remarkably, connect the yearning for spiritual progress in a human being with the biological necessity of the human body. One cannot but marvel,  with admiration , at their wisdom and deep scientific understanding of the body and the mind - Dr.Vivek Jawali

This is to awaken our security consciousness!!!.
A true life story is told of how armed robbers are snatching from unsuspecting people their vehicles nowadays.
In a wedding party or public gathering, they will meet the MC to make an announcement of a particular car with registration number so so and so, blocking them.
While you go out to move your car, some guys are waiting outside for you with a gun. They know you have the keys of your car.
You are then ordered to ride the car out of the compound with them inside already with you.
Please, Do the following when your vehicle registration number is being called out at a social function :
1) Take your time before going out.
2) Don't go out alone, at least in company of two or more people.
(3) Don't go directly to where the car is parked, at least to confirm from a distance if you are blocking another car truly.
And make sure there is a driver in the blocked car already before you go.
4) Watch your surroundings carefully before approaching the vehicle

15/10/16, 07:47 - Kampa Aunt: EvenThe Doctors Are Shocked: Coconut Oil Kills 93% Of Colon Cancer Cells In Only 2 Days.

According to the latest statistics, the medical experts claim that colon cancer is one of the most common cancer types, in both men and women! This is really shocking, because this terrible disease takes millions of lives around the world! But, you will be shocked when you find out that a group of researchers have found that this powerful ingredient can kill 93% of colon cancer cells – in just 2 days! Yes, we know – this is really amazing!

Study Confirms

Here’s what you need to know – a recent study, conducted by group of researchers at the Adelaide University of Australia, has discovered that lauric acid eliminates almost 93% of colon cancer cells just after 2 days of treatment.

This is extremely important for you to remember – this super healthy ingredient (coconut oil) is loaded with lauric acid – it’s almost half of the content of coconut oil. And, the most interesting thing is that the lauric acid contaminates the cancer cells by releasing intense oxidative stress. So, with this process, the lauric acid reduces the levels of glutathione in cancer cells very efficiently. 

This super healthy ingredient is loaded with healthy nutrients and it can provide many health benefits, but the big corporations tend to downplay its efficacy. The medical experts say that this powerful ingredient is very useful and beneficial in preventing and fighting many different health problems, such as: diabetes, osteoporosis, viral ailments (mononucleosis, hepatitis C, herpes and so forth.), biliary tract infections, Chron’s sickness, and cancer.

The Once Demonized Source of Fat…

Here’s what you need to know – back in the 1960’s, food manufacturers wanted consumers to buy their margarines and hydrogenated oils. And, in order to do that, they had to ‘discredit’ the products people had always used in their homes to prepare their food. The coconut oil has been “accused” of causing health issues while it was its replacements that were the real culprits.

Note: you should also know that many medical experts and researchers don’t think that coconut oil is the natural cure for cancer, but it’s a reminder for all the scientists in the world, who work in this field, that Mother Nature has provided many means and tools to fight this terrible and lethal disease. And we all should invest more in the medical researches and studies of these natural 
remedies.

 We really hope you find this article helpful and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family.

19/10/16, 14:41 - Puneeth: Last week Pappa got a call from supposedly an LIC officer in Delhi saying he is gonna get 1.45 lks dividend for his policy but 1 lk will go to the agent and pappa will receive only 45 k. He needs to open another dummy policy to get a customer number and transfer the old policy to his customer id and remove the agent details. So to open a new policy it's another 45k. And That it's the last day and has to do it now only. When I verified it was an organised way of conning policy holders. Many have been fooled
19/10/16, 14:50 - Dimpakka: 😮
19/10/16, 14:56 - Puneeth: They had even convinced Pappa by giving few numbers saying its of branch manager in Bangalore and to check with him if needed, which I'm sure was their our guy. They also said this is made possible because of Modi who wants the entire money to go to the policy holder and not the agent. Well created story

20/10/16, 12:33 - Kampa Aunt: 🔴Very important message🔴 

Please read this and take note. Let this not happen to you.. This could be a common mistake in any household.

This shocking accident
happend.  A housewife died due to burns sustained in the kitchen. Her husband too was hospitalized for injuries due to burns while trying to rescue his wife.

How it happened:

The gas was on and cooking in progress. 
The lady observed one cockroach near the sink and grabbed Spray bottle of insect killer and sprayed it near the gas, which was on. 
There was an explosion and in no time the poor woman was covered in flames, sustaining 65% burns.
Her husband rushed in, tried to put out the flames and his clothes too caught fire. 
The husband is still in hospital, in the burns ward, 
still unaware that his wife was declared dead on
arrival. 

Let us understand: - All insect killer sprays such as
"Hit", "Mortein" etc. have highly volatile and inflammable solvents.
The atomized nano spray particles spread very rapidly and one spark is enough to ignite this explosive mixture with oxygen present in air. 

Please educate your family & Friends about this and spread the word around.... 

Don't Keep this msg. in your inbox. Please share...
who knows you may🎈 save more than a life...

24/10/16, 09:40 - Kampa Aunt: DID YOU KNOW?

Our belly button is an amazing gift given to us by our creator. a 62 year old man had poor vision in his left eye. He could hardly see especially at night and was told by eye specialists that his eyes were in a good condition but the only problem was that the veins supplying blood to his eyes were dried up and he would never be able to see again. 


According to Science,  the first part created after the clot is formed is the belly button. After it’s created, it joins to the mother’s belly button through the umbilical chord.  



Our belly button is surely an amazing thing! According to science, after a person has passed away, the belly button is still warm for 3 hours the reason being when a woman conceives a child, her belly button supplies nourishment to the child through the child’s belly button. And a fully grown child is formed in 270 days = 9 months. This is the reason all our veins are connected to our belly button which makes it the focal point of our body. Belly button is life itself! 

The “PECHOTI” is situated behind the belly button which has 72,000 plus veins over it. The total amount of blood vessels we have in our body are equal to twice the circumference of the earth.
 CURES:

For dryness of eyes, poor eyesight, pancreas over or under working, cracked heels and lips, for glowing face, shiny hair, knee pain, shivering, lethargy, joint pains, dry skin.

REMEDY:

For dryness of eyes, poor eyesight, fungus in nails, glowing skin, shiny hair. At night before bed time, put 3 drops of pure ghee or coconut oil in your belly button and spread it 1 and half inches around your belly button
 
For knee pain At night before bed time, put 3 drops of castor oil in your belly button and spread it 1 and half inches around your belly button.

For shivering and lethargy, relief from joint pain, dry skin at night before bed time, put 3 drops of mustard oil in your belly button and spread it 1 and half inches around your belly button.

WHY PUT OIL IN YOUR BELLY BUTTON?

You belly button can detect which veins have dried up and pass this oil to it hence open them up.
When a baby has a stomach ache, we normally mix asafoetida (hing) and water or oil and apply around the naval. Within minutes the ache is cured. Oil works the same way.

25/10/16, 09:48 - Kampa Aunt: Stroke has a new indicator! They say if you forward this to ten people, you stand a chance of saving one life. Will you send this along? Blood Clots/Stroke - They Now Have a Fourth Indicator, the Tongue:

During a BBQ, a woman stumbled and took a little fall - she assured everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) ...she said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes.

They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up, Jane went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening.

Jane's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital - (at 6:00 PM Jane passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Jane would be with us today. Some don't die. They end up in a helpless, hopeless condition instead.

It only takes a minute to read this.

A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.
>>RECOGNIZING A STROKE<<

Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR. Read and Learn!

Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.

Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions:

S *Ask the individual to SMILE.

T *Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently)
(i.e. Chicken Soup)

R *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.

If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.

New Sign of a Stroke -------- Stick out Your Tongue

NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.

A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this e-mail sends it to 10 people; you can bet that at least one life will be saved.

I have done my part. Will you?

03/11/16, 14:58 - Kampa Aunt: With the help of mathematics I will predict how many siblings you have....
Try it .You will have a hard time believing it.

1.First, count the number of your brothers in your mind

2.Add 2 to that number.

3.Now multiply the resulting number with 2

4.Add 1 to it

5.Then multiply it by 5

6.Add the number of your sisters to it

7.Deduct 25 from the resulting number

8.Now you will get a number with two digits.The first digit represents the number of brothers while the second represents the number of sisters.

Shocked!!! So was I....🤔😇😇😇

👉We were never treated like  a pack of animals to carry our books to school.

👉While playing and riding bicycle, we never bothered to wear helmets.

👉After school time we played until its dusk but never watched t-world (TV) by locking up ourselves in a room.

👉We played only with our real friends, not with NET friends.
       
👉 If we ever felt thirsty, we used to drink tap water but never searched for bottled water.
           
 👉We never got ill even after sharing the same juice with four friends.
           
👉We were never put on weight even after eating plate full of sweets and rice everyday.
             
👉Nothing happened to our feet even after roaming bare foot.

👉We never used any health supplements to keep ourselves healthy.
             
👉We used to create our own toys and play with them.

👉We never had cellphones, DVDs, Play stations, XBoxes, video games, Personal computers, internet, chat but we had many real friends.

 👉We used to visit our friend's home uncalled and enjoyed food with them. We never had to call them and ask their permission to visit their home.
           
 👉Relatives were near to us so our hearts and souls were happy. Hence we never required any insurance policy.
           
👉We may have been in Black and White photos but you can find good colourful memories in those photos........

Help your domestic help, maid, driver, Aayah by educating them on how to exchange their money. Give them short term loans to help them tide next few days. Talk to them about this change. Don't let them get sucked into ponzi schemes. Do your bit please.

One serious request to all please do not exchange Rs 500 or 1000 with your local sabji wala , small vendors, thela wala, they may not be aware the fact and may not hold a bank account too. It may be complete loss to them.

Arthakranti Proposal

What is Arthakranti Proposal and who hasgiven the proposal?

“Arthakranti Proposal” has been given by a Pune (Maharashtra) based “Arthakranti Sansthan” which is an Economic Advisory body constituted by a group of Chartered Accountants and Engineers. This funda has been patented by the Sansthan.

Arthakranti Proposal is an effective and guaranteed solution of Black Money Generation, Price rise and Inflation, Corruption, Fiscal Deficit, Unemployment, Ransom, GDP and industrial growth, terrorism and good governance.

What is in the Proposal ?

“Arthakranti Proposal has FIVE point of actions simultaneously.

(1) Scrap all 56 Taxes including income tax excluding import duty.

(2) Recall and scrap high denomination currencies of 1000, 500 and 100 rupees.

(3) All high value transaction to be made only through banking system like cheque, DD, online and electronic.

(4) Fix limit of cash transaction and no taxing on cash transaction.

(5) For Govt. revenue collection introduce single point tax system through banking system – Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) on only Credit Amount

Important Points to note:

(1) As on today total banking transaction is more than 2.7 lakh crores per day say more than 800 lakh crores annually.

(2) Less than 20% transaction is made through banking system as on today and more than 80% transaction made in cash only, which is not traceable.

(3) 78% of Indian population spend less than 20/- rupees daily why they need 1000/- rupee note.

What will happen if All FIFTY SIX Taxes including income tax scrapped :

(1) Salaried people will bring home more money which will increase purchasing power of the family.

(2) All commodities including Petrol, Diesel, FMCG will become cheaper by 35% to 52% .

(3) No question of Tax evasion so no black money generation.

(4) Business sector will get boosted. So self employment.

What will happen if 1000/ 500/ 100 Rupees currency notes recalled and scrapped :

(1) Corruption through cash will stopped 100%.

(2) Black money will be either converted to white or will vanish as billions of 1000/500/100 currency notes hidden in bags without use will become simple pieces of papers.

(3) Unaccounted hidden huge cash is skyrocketing the prices of properties, land, houses, jewellery etc and hard earned money is loosing its value; this trend will stop immediately.

(4) Kidnapping and ransom, “Supari killing” will stop.

(5) Terrorism supported by cash transaction will stop.

(6) Cannot buy high value property in cash showing very less registry prices.

(7) Circulation of “Fake Currency” will stop because fake currency printing for less value notes will not be viable.

What will happen when Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) is implemented :

(1) As on today if BTT is implemented govt can fetch 800 x 2% = 16 lakh crore where as current taxing system is generating less than 14 lakh crore revenue.

(2)When 50% of total transaction will be covered by BTT sizing 2000 to 2500 lakh crores, Govt will need to fix BTT as low as 1% to 0.7% and this will boost again banking transaction many fold.

(3) No separate machinery like income tax department will be needed and tax amount will directly deposited in State/Central/District administration account immediately.

(4) As transaction tax amount will be very less, public will prefer it instead paying huge amount against directly/indirectly FIFTY SIX taxes.

(5) There will be no tax evasion and govt will get huge revenue for development and employment generation.

(6) For any special revenue for special projects, govt can slightly raise BTT say from 1% to 1.2% and this 0.2% increase will generate 4,00,000 crores additional fund.

Effect of if implemented today :

(01)Prices of all things will come down.

(02)Salaried people will get more cash in hand.

(03)Purchasing power of Society will increase.

(04)Demand will boost, so will production and industrialisation and ultimately more employment opportunity for youth.

(05) Surplus revenue to the govt for effective health/ education/ infrastructure/ security/ social works.

(06) Cheaper and easy loans from banks, interest rate will come down.

(07) Tendency of society will changes from scarcity to quantity.

(08) Spare money for political system for clean politics,

(09) Prices of land/ property will come down,

(10) No need to export beef to cover up trade deficit

(11) Sufficient fund for research and development.

(12) Society will be free from “Bad elements”.

A very nice n simple compilation with logical impact. Worth sharing!!

10/11/16, 13:28 - Kampa Aunt: *As frequent onion users we need to know this*

*ONIONS:* Please read to the end: important

In 1919 when the flu killed 40 million people there was this Doctor that visited the many farmers to see if he could help them combat the flu. Many of the farmers & their family had contracted it & many died.

The doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise, everyone was very healthy. When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home, (probably only 2 rooms back then). The doctor couldn't believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and place it under the microscope. She gave him one and when he did this, he did find the flu virus in the onion. It obviously absorbed the bacteria, therefore, keeping the family healthy.

Now there is a P. S. to this for I sent it to a friend in Oregon who regularly contributes material to me on health issues. She replied with this most interesting experience about onions:

Thanks for the reminder. I don't know about the farmer's story but, I do know that I contacted pneumonia, and, needless to say, I was very ill. I came across an article that said to cut both ends off an onion put it into an empty jar, and place the jar next to the sick patient at night. It said the onion would be black in the morning from the germs. sure enough it happened just like that the onion was a mess & I began to feel better.

This is the other note.

Lots of times when we have stomach problems we don't know what to blame. Maybe it's the onions that are to blame. *Onions ABSORB BACTERIA* is the reason they are so good at preventing us from getting *colds & flu* and is the very reason we should NOT eat an onion that has been sitting for a time after it has *been cut open.*

*Left over onions r poisonous*
When food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate *ONIONS* and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?). It's probably the *ONIONS,* and if not the onions, it's the *POTATOES.*

*Onions are a huge magnet* for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion.it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator.

It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!). If you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble. Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.

Also, dogs should never eat onions. Their stomachs cannot metabolize onions.

*Please remember it is dangerous to cut an onion and try to save it to cook with the next day, it becomes highly poisonous for even a single night - as it creates toxic bacteria which causes adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning.*

Please pass this to all the people whom you love and care about.

16/11/16, 07:43 - Kampa Aunt: Friends
I am Gautam Kar, retired Chief Commissioner of income tax. Government has to act within the framework of the Income tax Act.
 Suddenly new rates for levy of tax cannot be announced arbitrarily.
These have to meet the approval of Parliament.
If anyone of you have any money which you cannot explain,
treat it as income of the current year,
pay advance tax on it and include it in your total income for AY 2017-18.
At the most you will have to pay about 33% tax.
Question of penalty  on declared income cannot arise.

We can easily use cards, but for them, getting 100 rupees for few days is tough and will help them reinvest again in their business. Buy some from them, may be for just 100 rupees per day or on alternate days and it will  help them in a big way. Thank you and plz forward to others as well.

💄LIPSTICK INFORMATION

This comes from someone
Who works in the breast cancer unit at Mt. Sinai Hospital , in Toronto ..

💄From: Dr. Nahid Neman
💋If there is a female you care anything about..,
Share this with her.

👄Recently a lipstick brand called 'Red Earth'
Decreased their prices from
$67 to $9.90.
💋It contained lead.
Lead is a chemical which causes cancer.
💄The lipstick brands that contain lead are:
👄CHRISTIAN DIOR
💄LANCÃME
💋LAKME
💄MAYBELINE
💋CLINIQUE
💄Y.S.L.
👄ESTEE LAUDER
💋SHISEIDO
💄RED EARTH (Lip Gloss)
👄CHANEL (Lip Conditioner)
💋MARKET AMERICA-💄MOTNES LIPSTICK.
💋EL18
💄MANY LOCAL BRANDS SELLING IN CHINA, INDIA, UK, SINGAPORE, HONGKONG, USA, MALAYSIA..
👄The higher the lead content,
💄The greater the chance of causing cancer.
💋After doing a test on lipsticks,
👄It was found that the Y.S.L. Lipstick
Contained the most amount of lead.
💄Watch out for those lipsticks
Which are supposed to stay longer.
💋If your lipstick stays longer, it is
Because of the higher content of lead.

Here is the test you can do yourself:

1. Put some lipstick on your hand👋
2. Use a Gold ring to scratch on the lipstick💍.
3. If the lipstick colour changes to black,
Then you know the lipstick contains lead.

Please send this information to all your Sisters,  Wife.., Daughters,..., and other female family members and female friend .

29/11/16, 10:21 - Kampa Aunt: Dear Friends, 
This is the time where Indians are shifting from cash transaction to electronic transaction. Whenever we use a debit card or credit card, do you know that there is a transaction fee associated with it? In most cases you may not be charged but the merchant will be charged. Let us understand what this is for. First of all, no banks or any entities provide any sought of financial networks. It’s all provided by international companies namely VISA, MasterCard, American Express etc. For example, when you get an ATM card with VISA label on that from the issuing bank, the bank provides you the facility to use the visa network. For that the bank has to pay a nominal fee to VISA for every transaction. The bank will get this back from the merchant. So each transaction makes these foreign companies rich.
Now let us see about the RuPay technology introduced by NPCI (National Payment Corporation of India) under the guidelines of RBI (Reserve Bank of India). RuPay is a similar network as VISA, MasterCard etc. This is managed by Reserve Bank of India. All most all public sector and private banks have started to give RuPay based cards to their customers. RuPay cards got a major boost through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as RuPay cards were issued to all Jan Dhan accounts.
The advantages are lot. The main advantage is the transaction charges. Charges are very minimal. While Visa / MasterCard / Amex cards creates a transaction fee of about 1.9% of the total amount, RuPay will charge only 0.01%. Secondly, these charges in turn go to the Reserve Bank Itself. Third and the most important - All the transactional data lies in the Indian Servers. The good news is that NPCI is trying to make it international, which means foreign banks will start using RuPay cards. You can get more information about RuPay from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPay
Next time when you apply or renew a card, opt for RuPay card. Let’s make India better. 
Please forward this information to all your friends.

20/12/16, 14:39 - Kampa Aunt: Why walk is necessary ?         Good Information 

Ever wondered what happens to your body when you start walking?

Here's a minute-by   -minute rundown of the amazing chain reaction walking and exercise has upon your body, it's truly amazing!

Minutes 1 to 5

Your first few steps trigger the release of energy-producing chemicals in your cells to fuel your walk. Your heart rate revs-up from about 70 to 100 beats per minute (bpm), boosting blood-flow and warming muscles.

Any stiffness subsides as joints release lubricating fluid to help you move more easily. As you get moving, your body burns 5 calories per minute, compared with only 1 per minute at rest. Your body needs more fuel and starts pulling from its carbohydrates and fat stores.

Minutes 6 to 10

Heartbeat increases and you're burning up to 6 calories a minute as you pick up the pace. A slight rise in blood pressure is countered by the release of chemicals that expand blood vessels, bringing more blood and oxygen to working muscles.

Minutes 11 to 20

Your body temperature keeps rising, and you start to perspire as blood vessels near the skin expand to release heat. As your walk becomes brisker, you'll be burning up to 7 calories a minute and breathing harder. Hormones such as epinephrine and glucagon rise to release fuel to the muscles.

Minutes 21 to 45

Feeling invigorated, you start to relax as your body releases tension, thanks in part to a dose of feel-good chemicals such as endorphins in your brain. As more fat is burned, insulin (which helps store fat) drops--excellent news for anyone battling excess weight or diabetes.

Minutes 46 to 60

Your muscles may feel fatigued as carbohydrates stores are reduced. As you cool down, your heart rate decreases and your breathing slows. You'll be burning fewer calories but more than you were before you started. Your calorie burn will remain elevated for up to 1 hour.

All this happens without a single conscious thought from us - the human body is amazing....
Stay blessed -Stayfit..
Walk / Exercise..          
Kindly forward to as many as possible...

*Ducks Quack, Eagles Soar*

I was waiting in line for a ride at the airport in Dubai. When a cab pulled up, the first thing I noticed was that the taxi was polished to a bright shine. Smartly dressed in a white shirt, black tie, and freshly pressed black slacks, the cab driver jumped out and rounded the car to open the back passenger door for me.

He handed me a laminated card and said: 'I'm Abdul, your driver. While I'm loading your bags in the trunk I'd like you to read my mission statement.'

Taken aback, I read the card. It said: Abdul's Mission Statement:
To get my customers to their destination in the quickest, safest and cheapest way possible in a friendly environment.

This blew me away. Especially when I noticed that the inside of the cab matched the outside. Spotlessly clean!

As he slid behind the wheel, Abdul said, 'Would you like a cup of coffee? I have a thermos of regular and one of decaf.'

I said jokingly, 'No, I'd prefer a soft drink.'

Abdul smiled and said, 'No problem. I have a cooler up front with regular and Diet Coke, lassi, water and orange juice.'

Almost stuttering, I said, 'I'll take a Lassi.'

Handing me my drink, Abdul said, 'If you'd like something to read, I have The NST , Star and Sun Today.'

As they were pulling away, Abdul handed me another laminated card, 'These are the stations I get and the music they play, if you'd like to listen to the radio.'

And as if that weren't enough, Abdul told me that he had the air conditioning on and asked if the temperature was comfortable for me.

Then he advised me of the best route to my destination for that time of day. He also let me know that he'd be happy to chat and tell me about some of the sights or, if I preferred, to leave me with my own thoughts.

'Tell me, Abdul ,' I was amazed and asked him, 'have you always served customers like this?'

Abdul smiled into the rear view mirror. "No, not always. In fact, it's only been in the last two years. My first five years driving, I spent most of my time complaining like all the rest of the cabbies do. Then I heard about POWER OF CHOICE one day."

Power of choice is that you can be a duck or an eagle.

'If you get up in the morning expecting to have a bad day, you'll rarely disappoint yourself. Stop complaining!'

'Don't be a duck. Be an eagle. Ducks quack and complain. Eagles soar above the crowd.'

'That hit me. really hard' said Abdul.

'It is about me. I was always quacking and complaining, so I decided to change my attitude and become an eagle. I looked around at the other cabs and their drivers. The cabs were dirty, the drivers were unfriendly, and the customers were unhappy. So I decided to make some changes, slowly ... a few at a time. When my customers responded well, I did more.'

'I take it that it has paid off for you,' I said.

'It sure has,' Abdul replied. 'My first year as an eagle, I doubled my income from the previous year. This year I'll probably quadruple it. My customers call me for appointments on my cell phone or leave a message on it.'

Abdul made a different choice. He decided to stop quacking like a duck and start soaring like an eagle.

Start becoming an eagle today ... one small step every week..next week... And next...And....

A great Thought..

"You don't die if you fall in water, you die only if you don't swim.

Thats the Real Meaning of Life.

Improve yourself and your skills in a different way.
Be an eagle. .not a Duck.

01/02/17, 12:32 - Geethathe: The Bride kissed her father and placed something in his hand.
Everyone in the room was wondering what was given to the father by the bride. The father could feel the suspense in the air and all eyes were on him to divulge the secret and say something.
So he announced: " Ladies and Gentlemen, today is the luckiest day of my life. Then he raised his hands with what his daughter gave him and
said...... My daughter has finally returned my Credit Card to me!!!" 💳 The whole audience burst into laughter😄😄😄😄........ .....But one was in complete silence...  The Groom 😳😁😷😄😜😝😂😂

This warning has come from an officer working at the airport.
Be careful !!!! 

At the airport or close to any customs service, never accept or help somebody to hold his/her bottle of water or other objects , even for an elderly person or a pregnant woman, 
You could be arrested for cocaine or illegal drugs possession.
In Singapore/Dubai, that means the Death Penalty !! 
Tell them to put the item on the floor or at any other place...

21/03/17, 09:51 - Kampa Aunt: Another rape 
Technique in Town. 

Ladies pls be careful.

A woman was taken 
by 5 men, 
who according to 
hospital and police report was raped by a 
gang before 
being dumped at a 
bus
station!

Though she was unable 
to remember 
the events of the previous evening, 
tests conducted 
revealed that she had 
been raped repeatedly.

There was a 
trace of 
Rohypnol in her blood.

Rohypnol, 
is presently being 
used as a date rape drug.

It is actually
 a small sterilization 
pill which is now being 
used by 
rapists to drug their 
targets at 
parties.

The drug makes the 
mind of the 
target (would be victim) 
go blank 
so that she does not remember 
anything that transpired and worse still, 
the drug sterilizes the victim so that 
she doesn't conceive 
from the rape 
and the rapist need not worry about 
having his identity 
revealed 
later by a paternity 
test.

The real bad news is 
that the drug's 
side effects 

ARE NOT TEMPORARY, 

they are
PERMANENT.

Any female that 
takes it 

WILL NEVER BE ABLE 
TO CONCEIVE.

The drug is
administered by 
dropping it into the 
target's drink.

The girl wouldn't 
remember a thing the 
next morning, 
nothing at all that had 
taken place the 
night before 
will she remember.

Rohypnol, dissolves 
rapidly and 
easily in drinks, leaving 
no taste and 
no change in color 
which makes it 
impossible to detect.

These weasels can 
get this drug 
from anyone who is in 
the vet school or 
any medical  university.

It's that easy and 
Rohypnol is about to 
break out big 
on campuses everywhere.

Believe it or not, 
there are 
even sites on the 
internet telling 
people 
how to use it.

Girls, 
please be careful when you're out, 
especially on a date, 
don't leave your 
drink unattended.

(Buy your own drinks, ensure bottles 
or cans received are unopened or sealed; 
don't even taste 
someone else's drink).

There has already 
been a report in Nigeria 
of girls' drinks 
being spiked by 
Rohypnol.

For guys - 
Please inform all your female family members, relatives and friends. 

Remember you also 
have sisters or 
might one day have 
a daughter(s).

Important News are 
meant to be 
passed on, 
please don't keep or 
ignore.

This was sent to me 
and I feel I 
should pass it on so that 
we are better 
equipped to protect 
our loved ones.

Please share to 
protect and save lives.

23/03/17, 22:42 - Kampa Aunt: Dear bank customers please withdraw your total amount from bank's before March 31st. Use only Cash transaction no digital transaction, then we can avoid all types of service charges. And also we can teach bankers a lesson. Banks are depending on customers, customers are not depending on bank's.
      Let us Show power of the people.✊👍🤝.
*Q*:- _*What's wrong with Cashless Transaction*_..?

*A*:- _Sir think that a 100 rupee note is circulated 1,00,000 times it will have the same value, nobody gets any commission_.

_But if it is circulated through cashless transactions, each transaction fetches *2.5%* commission, that means 1,00,000 times 2.5% = 2500% i.e. Rs. 2,50,000 (Rs. Two Lakhs fifty thousand Rupees) to service providers like Paytm or Jio Money etc. *Just for hundred rupees*_. 

_So, it's a perpetual golden egg laying goose gifted to the gang_.                               

_That's why this is the *Mother of all scams* Very important statistics please read & understand, no politics in this_.                                                                              

*Do you know*...

1) _Debit Cards charge between 0.5% to 1% to the retailer Or money receiver for every transaction_.

2) _Credit Cards charge beteen 1.5%-2.5% to the retailer of the money receiver for every transaction_.

3) _PayTM/Freecharge/ Jio Money and other E-wallets charger 2.5% -3.5% when you want to transfer your e-wallet money into your bank a/c_.

_RBI data shows that every month around 2.25 lakh crore (Anually Rs 25 -30 lakh crores) is withdrawn from ATM's across India. And it is estimated that along with bank withdrawals, a total of Rs 75 lakh crore is withdrawn ( both banks and ATMs) on a yearly basis. All this is accounted/tax-payed money which is withdrawn from banks. Currently, just 3% of transactions are in electronic mode_...

_If this 75 lakh crore is converted into a *#cashlesseconomy*, look at how much the companies will earn.. (75 lakh crores times 2% average)  Rs 1.5 lakh crore per year!_... 
*NO KIDDING!*

_*This is the biggest open scam. Direct benefit for Corporates like Reliance, PayTM, e-Banks etc. of Rs 1.5 lakh crores per year*_...

_This makes me wonder, was Demonetization done to end black money or was it actually done to benefit Corporates_?

_*I request you all to share this important eye opening message*_.

27/03/17, 13:50 - Kampa Aunt: Any body who is too much stressed or confused should read this again and again.....I got all my answers..Try this..

A rare conversation between Guru Nanak sahib  & Today's Sikh ( human ) .  Read it loud to family,
it's one of  the best message I have come across...

1. Sikh ( human ):- *_I can’t find free time. Life has become hectic._*

Guru Nanak sahib :- *Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free.*

2.  Sikh ( human ) :- *_Why has life become complicated now?_*

Guru Nanak sahib   :- *Stop analyzing life... It makes it complicated. Just live it.*

3. Sikh ( human ) :- *_Why are we then constantly unhappy?_*

Guru Nanak sahib :- *Worrying has become your habit. That’s why you are not happy.*

4. Sikh ( human ) :- *_Why do good people always suffer?_*

 Guru Nanak sahib :- *Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don’t suffer.*
*With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.*

5. Sikh ( human ) :- *_You mean to say such experience is useful?_*

 Guru Nanak sahib :- *Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. It gives the test first and the lessons later.*

6. Sikh ( human ) :- *_Because of so many problems, we don’t know where we are heading…_*

Guru Nanak sahib :- *If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.*

7. Sikh ( human ) :- *_Does failure hurt more than moving in the right direction?_**

Guru Nanak sahib :- *Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you.*

8. Sikh ( human ) :- *_In tough times, how do you stay motivated?_*

 Guru Nanak sahib :- *Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.*

9. Sikh ( human ) :- *_What surprises you about people?_*

 Guru Nanak sahib :- *When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?"*

10. Sikh ( human ) :- *_How can I get the best out of life?_*

Guru Nanak sahib :- *Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.*

11.Sikh ( human )  :- *_One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered._*

Guru Nanak sahib :- *There are no unanswered prayers. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Life is a mystery to  solve not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.*

Stay blessed and
Stay Happy Always.....!!!😊👍

Today please see moon 🌙 from 10.24 pm till 11.44 pm, it will change its color in 12 different colors, such incident will next come after 184 years, you all please see
🌙🌛🌛and inform everybody to see.
01/04/17, 18:08 - Kampa Aunt: Dear all, 
 
the Equinox phenomenon  will affect us  in the next 5 days. Please stay indoors and keep animals indoor or protected   especially from 12pm-3pm daily. The temperature will fluctuate  and may reach  40 degrees Celsius. This can easily cause dehydration and sun stroke. (Ps: this phenomena is due to the sun directly positioned above the equator line. )
Please keep everyone inclusive of yourself hydrated. Everyone should be consuming about 3 litres of fluid everyday. Monitor everyone's blood pressure as frequent as possible. Many may get heat stroke.

Take Cold showers as frequent as possible. Reduce meat 
increase fruits & veg.

Heat wave is no joke! Place a new unused candle outside home area or exposed area. If candle can melt, its at a dangerous level.

Always place a pail or 2 of water half filled in living room & each in every room to keep temperature down.

 heat stroke has no indicative symptoms. Once you faint, its serious & dangerous as organ failure kicks in.

Always check lips, eye balls for  moisture.
Please inform others...
 Stay safe friends!

10/04/17, 18:36 - Kampa Aunt: A simple yet powerful trick to quickly get the answer:

Many a times when we are in market buying vegetables, fruits etc or buying tickets we use 100 or 1000 rupee notes. This type of maths is useful. 
🔸 When we want to deduct any sum from figures like 
10, 100, 1000, 10000 etc this trick is useful  🔸
Examples :-
1. We want to deduct 674 from 1000....what will you do?
For this deduct first figure from 9 and the last figure from 10. So the answer is...
  9 - 6 = 3
  9 - 7 = 2
10 - 4 = 6
Your answer : 326

2. 10000 - 4328 = ?
As said earlier..

    9 - 4 = 5
    9 - 3 = 6
    9 - 2 = 7
  10 - 8 = 2
Answer is 5672.

3. 100000 - 66758 = ?
        9 - 6 = 3
        9 - 6 = 3
        9 - 7 = 2
        9 - 5 = 4
      10 - 8 = 2
And you get : 33242 !!👌🏼

This trick can be useful to you as well as students in competition exams etc.

Maths is FUN. 😊😊
10/04/17, 18:43 - Kampa Aunt: *The big myth on Income Tax Payers in India;*

 Data from a Chartered Accountants' group.......;
✍ FM said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax *'non- compliant'* society and presented that only *3.7 crores* are  filing ITRs in this poor country of 125 crore population .

*The reply by CAs :*

Sir, 
We have 82 crore voters out of which,

- *75% are agriculturists*  ie. 61.5 crores ( You exempted them straightaway, but they can also buy cars , bungalows etc. as you quoted.. Your political colleagues are also enjoying this exemption) 

*Balance remains.......20.5 crores* 

*Less:24% BPL class* ( Below poverty line)

Means 15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. 

*Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below-taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%)* ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....

*Balance: (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filing it...*

.... So almost no gap as FM  is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his country🤓😝😱

if FM wants more people to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc viewed as *tax terrorism*  ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers *( Politicians are also enjoying this exemption )*

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...
*come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers* ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )

3. *Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*

4. *Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filed for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance* 

5. *Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..*

Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits.... 

As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filing ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...😊
*LET'S SPREAD THIS TO EDUCATE HONEST TAX PAYERS*

11/04/17, 15:38 - Kampa Aunt: Linking Aadhaar with PAN.                                                                   
As you are all aware linking of Aadhaar number with PAN is made mandatory for filing of Income Tax Returns now. Many people are facing difficulty in this regard.As the name appearing on Aadhaar card did not match exactly as appearing on PAN card I also faced difficulty in linking. The best solution is to modify your name on the Aadhaar Crad. I followed the following procedure on my laptop and successfully changed the name on the Aadhaar card and linked the Aadhaar number and PAN successfully and without any difficulty. I was also able to generate my eAadhar card. Every thing was done from home , not visiting any Aadhaar centre.  Please  note that this is possible only if your mobile number is recorded on your Aadhaar  card.
The Procedure/ Steps I followed are as under. You may also try.
1] Take a xerox copy of your PAN card on a full white sheet of paper.
2]Self attest it with your signature.
3]Write your name and Aadhaar number on the Xerox copy.
4]Scan the Xerox sheet.
5]Open the UIDAI website.
6]Enter Aadhaar Number.
7]Enter the OTP you receive n proceed.
8]Select the option change/update Aadhaar Details.
9] Change /modify your name as appearing on PAN.
10]Upload the scanned Xerox copy.
 Normally within a day or two the change /modification is effected.
Once the change is effected you can easily link Aadhaar number and PAN.
 A new card is issued .It may take a few more days.
If you are in a hurry you you can download eAadhar card . If you visit UIDAI website only 3-4 steps are needed. Enter Aadhaar number,name as modified, pincode etc. You get OTP. Enter the OTP. Then Download the eAadhaar. I have successfully downloaded it in colour.
Everything was done from the comfort of home and without any extra expense. You also can try if you have a computer/laptop and internet connection!!!!!!!

The German doctor says: "That's nothing,
in Germany we took part of a brain, put it in another man, and in 4 weeks he is looking for a job."

The Russian doctor says: "Gentlemen, we took half a heart from a man, put it in another's chest, and in 2 weeks he is looking for a job."

The American doctor laughs: "You are all behind us. A few days ago, we took a man with no brain, no heart, and no liver and made him President.

Now, the whole country is looking for a job!"

17/04/17, 19:51 - Geethathe: There is evidence of the cultivation of millet in the Korean Peninsula dating to the Middle Jeulmun Pottery Period (around 3,500–2,000BC). In India, millets have been mentioned in some of the oldest Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (priyangava), Barnyard millet (aanava) and black finger millet (shyaamaka), thus indicating that millet consumption was very common, pre-dating to the Indian Bronze Age (4,500BC).

18/04/17, 07:20 - Geethathe: A luxury residential building in Houston is making quite a buzz for one unique amenity- its swimming pool. The 'Sky Pool' on the 40th floor of the building overlooks the city and is extended 10 feet beyond the edge of the building. That's like swimming in the sky with a bird's eye view of the city. But just to make you feel better, the pool, a part of which is suspended in the air, is built with a shatterproof 8-inch thick plexiglass bottom.

29/04/17, 11:50 - Puneeth: I've Been hunting for a good resort in coorg. Since v r booking late & in peak season the options r very few. All resorts r 5k and above in this area. There r no good resorts left in the price range 5-8k. For the facilities v r looking for there are 1-2 resorts left for Rs. 8k- 9k per night. If v need to stick to 5k accommodation is there no entertainment for kids. V need to depend more on sight seeing. If everyone is ok with 8-9 k per night accommodation and for 2 nights it's abt 16k then we need to book it soon. All r in high demand. Plz let me know today

02/05/17, 06:30 - Kampa Aunt: *IMPORTANT. PLEASE READ ALL THE WAY, NOT SOMETHING ANYONE WOULD NORMALLY THINK OF.*

A stock clerk was sent to clean up a storeroom in Maui, Hawaii.

When he got back, he was complaining that the storeroom was really filthy and that he had noticed dried mouse/rat droppings in some areas!

A couple of days later, he started to feel like he was coming down with a stomach flu, complained of sore joints and headaches and began to vomit.

He went to bed and never really got up again. Within two days he was severely ill and weak. His blood sugar count was down to 66 and his face and eyeballs were yellow. He was rushed to the emergency at Pali-Momi, where he was diagnosed to be suffering from massive organ failure. He died shortly before midnight.

No one would have made the connection between his job and his death, had it not been for a doctor who specifically asked if he had been in a warehouse or exposed to dried rat/mouse droppings at anytime.

They said there is a virus (much like the Hanta Virus) that lives in dried rat and mouse droppings.

Once dried, these droppings are like dust and can easily be breathed in or ingested if a person does not wear protective gear or fails to wash face and hands thoroughly.

An autopsy was performed on the clerk to verify the doctor's suspicions...

This is why it is _extremely important_ to ALWAYS carefully rinse off the tops of canned sodas or foods and to wipe off pasta packaging, cereal boxes and so on.

Almost everything you buy in a supermarket was stored in a warehouse at one time or another and stores themselves often have rodents.

Most of us remember to wash vegetables and fruits but never think of boxes and cans.

The ugly truth is, even the most modern, upper-class, super store has rats and mice. And their warehouse most assuredly does!

Whenever you buy any canned soft drink, please make sure that you wash the top with running water and soap or if that is not available, drink with a straw.

The investigation of soda cans by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta discovered that the tops of soda cans can be encrusted with dried rat's urine, which is so toxic it can be lethal.

Canned drinks and other foodstuffs are stored in warehouses and containers that are usually infested with rodents and then they get transported to retail outlets without being properly cleaned.

Please forward this message to the people you care about (I JUST DID!)

04/05/17, 20:40 - Kampa Aunt: Dear All,
This is to inform you that medicines are prescribed (by doctors) by brand name not by the generics (Ingredients). Hence we end up paying more money for the same medicine.
 
Follow these few steps to know more start saving on your medical bills.
 
1. Simply goto www.Manddo.com (Medicines and Doctors online) goto medicines section 
2. Search the medicine name
3. Type the medicine name which you are using (e. g. Lyrica 75mg (Pfizer company)
4. It will show u medicine company, prices and Ingredients
5. Now main point CLICK ON 'SUBSTITUTE'
6. Don't be surprised to see that same drug is available at very low cost also. And that to by other reputed manufacturer. e. g. Lyrica by pfizer is for Rs. 768.56 for 14 tab (54.89 per tab). Whereas same drug by Cipla is available ONLY @ Rs. 59.00 for 10 tab (5.9 per tab) 
 
Please don't delete   without forwarding.
Forward to all the contacts in your phone book.
Let the move by Supreme Court benefit everyone...
There was a big lobby by Pharma companies to stop generic medicines. But court kept the interest of common man and the medical need.

07/05/17, 16:29 - Kampa Aunt: *Seenagers* 😀😀

Friends I just discovered our age group catagory -
A light hearted view on the life cycle - "being a Senior, means being a Seenager!"
I just discovered my age group! 
I am a Seenager.....(senior teenager)
I have everything that I wanted as a teenager, only 50 years later.

I don't have to go to school or work; I get an allowance every month.

I have my own pad, I don't have a curfew, I have a driver's license & my own car.
I have IDs that gets me into bars & the wine store - I like the wine store the best.

People I hang around with, are not scared of getting pregnant, they're not scared of anything,
they've been blessed to live this long, so why be scared? And I don't have acne. Life is good! 

You'll feel much more intelligent after reading this, if you are a Seenager.
Brains of older people are slow, because they know so much. People do not decline mentally with age; 
it just takes them longer to recall facts, because they have more information in their brains. Scientists believe, this also makes you hard of hearing, as it puts physical pressure on your inner ear.

Also, older people often go to another room to get something & when they get there, they stand there
 wondering what they came for. It is  not a memory problem; it is nature's way of making older people 
do more exercise.
So there... I have more friends I should send this to, but right now I can't remember their names.

So, please forward this to your friends; they may be my friends, too.
Cheers! 

Oh by the way, as the year progresses, please take special care of yourself & avoid injuries, because 
spare parts for old models are no longer in stock, as most of us are the 40s; 50s & 60s models .
The warranty period is long over and the expiry date is due soon. Caution is better than a fixing. 
Have to remind yourselves, "We are a limited edition". 😀😀

10/05/17, 16:57 - Kampa Aunt: Long one but interesting read
10/05/17, 16:57 - Kampa Aunt: The best conversation between two characters from Mahabharat 👌👌


Karna asks Krishna - "My mother left me the moment I was born.
Is it my fault I was born an illegitimate child?

 I did not get education from Dhronacharya because I was considered a non Kshatriya.

 ParshuRam taught me but then gave me the curse to forget everything since I was a kshatriya.

A cow was accidentally hit by my arrow & 
its owner cursed me for no fault of mine.

 I was disgraced in Draupadi's swayamvar.

 Even Kunti finally told me the truth only to save her other sons.

Whatever I received was through Dhuryodhana's charity. 
So how am I wrong in taking his side?"


Krishna replies,
 "Karna, I was born in a jail.

 Death was waiting for me even before my birth.

 The night I was born I was separated from my birth parents. 


From childhood you grew up hearing the noise of swords, chariots, horses, bow and arrows.

 I got only cow herd's shed, dung and multiple attempts on my life even before I could walk!

No army, no education.

 I could hear people saying I am the reason for all their problems. 


When all of you were being appreciated for your valour by your teachers,
I had not even received any education.

 I joined gurukula of Rishi Sandipani only at the age of 16!

You are married to a girl of your choice.

I didn't get the girl I loved & 
rather ended up marrying those who wanted me or the ones I rescued from demons.

I had to move my whole community from the banks of Yamuna to far off Sea shore,
 to save them from Jarasandh. 
I was called a coward for running away.


If Dhuryodhana wins the war you will get lot of credit.
 What do I get if Dharmaraja wins the war? 
Only the blame for the war and all related problems.

Remember one thing Karna....

 Everybody has challenges in life.

*LIFE IS NOT FAIR ON ANYBODY..*

 Dhuryodhan also has a lot of unfairness in life and so has Yudhishthir. 

But what is Right (Dharma) is known to your
Mind (Conscience)....

No matter how much unfairness we got, 
how many times we were disgraced,
 how many times we were denied what was due to us, 
what is important is,
 How you REACTED at that time...

Stop whining Karna.

Life's unfairness does not give you license to walk the wrong path of *अधर्म.*

17/05/17, 11:26 - Kampa Aunt: 🚫DELETE WHATSAPP🚫
Today our PM Modi ji spoke a slogan of Made In India.
     Come lets start with using TELEGRAM an Indian app instead of using the American app WhatsApp.
🔹It is the first Indian social media app.

Think about it...Even the Chinese have refused WhatsApp and adopted the Made in China "WeChat", when we are going to start??
Use Whatsapp for one year & stop it!


Its one year cost is 56 Rupees, and In India there are 20crore Indians....
If we use WhatsApp then 20crore × 56rupees=1120crore rupees will go outside India, to create awareness please send this msg to everyone & download TELEGRAM.

🔘TELEGRAM has more functions then WhatsApp:-
🔸It can send 50MB video
🔸It can even send Word, Excel & Adobe files
🔸In a group, 200 people can be added
🔸It is free of cost, no charges at all
🔸The most important thing, it works same as WhatsApp & the interface is also like Whatsapp only..
So today onwards use 💌TELEGRAM💌
🇮🇳Indian🇮🇳

Forward this message to 25 WhatsApp contacts. u wil get Rs.497.54 talktime.

Watch in today Times of India newspaper. Page no 7.  thank you.

17/05/17, 16:46 - Kampa Aunt: *Advice from an Advocate :*

Dear All,
I Wanted to highlight a very important aspect. In ordinary course we keep issuing and submitting our *KYC documents* (proofs such as *AADHAR Card* , *PAN card*,  *LICENCE* etc.) to various people. 

For housing or car or other loans, bank accounts,or even for _buying new sim card_ we submit these documents.

At almost all these places they ask for self certification on these documents. We immediately sign those documents and hand over.

Just imagine your self certified copies are freely available in the hands of such persons & those documents can be used by him for EVERYTHING!  

For eg: Your *AADHAR / PAN Card / BSNL Bill* gets into the hands of a *Terrorist, he can misuse it to buy a SIM in your name AND YOU MIGHT BE ARRESTED for having Terror links*

Its really serious and its been seen that in most of the terrorist activities, KYC documents are sourced from the SIM card sellers.

Hence, please inculcate a 'HABIT' of *writing the date and purpose for which you are submitting the self certified KYC Documents* so that those documents cannot be used again.
Please share this as much as possible Forwarded as I felt
Necessary to everyone.

 *it's very important to write the date and purpose, which we never do while submitting KYC documents.*

*Here after sign as
1..........signature
2..........Date
3.........Purpose
4. and not to be used for other purpose.*

Plz dont ignore and pass this msg to as many people u can..

22/05/17, 18:11 - Kampa Aunt: WAX IN STOMACH:

Varun, an IT professional , was finding himself with an upset stomach every night. While normal medical checks revealed nothing wrong in him, deeper probes revealed the reason – his stomach was collecting significant amounts of wax. And doctors identified the villian – the ordinary disposable paper cups he used for drinking his tea at his office pantry.Disposable paper cups have become quite popular in office pantries due to the convenience it offers. What many overlook is the fact that these paper cups are coated with a tiny layer of wax, which is essential to prevent water from seeping into the paper. When very hot liquids are pour over this cup, the paper cups wax may disintegrate and a little maycome off, which will promptly be sent along with the drink into our stomachs! While our body can discard minor amounts, over the long-term, it does become aproblem.So what can be done about it? You can try to bring your own glass cups. Glass is one of the least reactive materials in the world (remember acids are stored in glass vessels, blood samples are collected in glass plates – these are for a good reason). But glass does have the problem of breaking easily, so it requires good care. Ceramic cups are probably the best bet. Of course, you can also use your ordinary stainless steel glass, but never use plastic ones – they are harmful, and its dangers are even worse than wax.

PLEASE DO NOT USE DISPOSABLE CUPS (Plastic or paper) for hot drinks like tea, coffee and milk.

Share if you care.

Today China is the under the threat of economical slump. So china has devaluated its currency by 30%. According to the global economists, China will face economical slowdown by decreasing the prices of products by its domestic industries . so Chinese products will be available at very cheaper rate in Indian and other markets.
     But this is time to weaken Chinese economy, which we can do. Coz India is the biggest market for the China across the globe. China is making a business of 6.2 million crore of Indian rupees per annum from  Indian market.
       And as we know China is claiming Indian territory and acquiring border areas,It seems that China is always  in war stance with India. Also China is supporting Pakistan openly  to counter India to become a sub-continental leader.
       Hence this is the time to crush Chinese economy, hence I am requesting  each and every Indian  not to buy any Chinese product for upcoming one month at least. It will be great if you will not buy product ever which is Made in China.Even here to make an appeal to all Indian Merchants and retailers that plz do not deal in Chinese products for upcoming one month as those products are going to be more cheaper.
       This is the time to slap china and to become A Patriotic Indian. Lets do it for Nation.
Guys,. We are sharing tonnes of useless whatsapp messages daily.  Spread this message as much as you can.We should avail each n every chance to counter against the powerful enemy like China.
     As the responsible citizen of The Republic of India, I am requesting you to make this message viral. Do not miss a single contact from your phone book.
      Your deed of not buying Chinese products and to tell the same to others is equally important to the Nation as the service by An Indian Soldier on our borders!
             || Jai Hind ||

15/06/17, 17:53 - Kampa Aunt: Beware of this silent killer..!

Last Sunday,I had travelled by train in a third AC compartment from Tiruvalla to Trivandrum, which started at 8 pm and reached by quarter to eleven.
Once settled ,most of the people dozed off instantly after spending few minutes observing the co passengers .Sleeping in the sitting posture in a chair car, leaves you with no option other than keeping your legs down. I kept moving my ankle joints and stood up once in a while to avoid a dreaded complication .. Deep vein thrombosis (  DVT )!
Not even a single person changed the position or moved their limbs..
I had to suppress myself a lot from waking them up and give awareness regarding this silent killer, though my mind was speaking loud..!
Prolonged limited mobility of lower limbs while travelling when coupled with dehydration and other risk factors favours the formation of clots in the deep bigger veins and can remain silent without any symptoms.
This condition commonly presents as swelling of the limbs.
The clot can dislodge as a whole or in fragments and is carried to the heart, where it blocks the main blood vessel to the lungs thus depriving the lungs of oxygen. Severe breathlessness follows and can be fatal if not treated at the right time..! I personally have seen patients with DVT after festivals that demanded prolonged standing.. and car journey as short as 2 hours..!
Instances were there when people have collapsed at airports after long distance travel especially after a period of immobilisation.

This post is intended for the general public who has no awareness of this condition..!
Any mode of transport... any long distance journey.. drink plenty of fluids and keep moving your legs and ankle joints, so that stasis does not occur. If by road, stop the vehicle in between and walk few steps before resuming journey!!

21/06/17, 10:01 - Dimpakka: Ramasamy completed B.tech and joined a MNC during Campus Recruitment. CTC 4 lakhs. His Relatives & Family friends wished him success. Ramasamy's face glowed like Petramax light. He thought  to himself " From today onwards every day will be happy."

Madasamy, Ramasamy's neighbor  failed BA. All his relatives & family friends blamed him. In Hyderabad every one is a B.tech but Madasamy was not even BA! Madasamy received suggestions to eke out a living by selling Idly, Dosa….   Pan ...or sell Milk…  His Father was much embarrassed. 
Now what to do…? 
Madasamy asked his mother ₹ 2 lakhs and borrowed ₹2 lakhs from an uncle, bought buffaloes and started Milk Business.

Ramasamy used his credit card to purchase a motorcycle , commuting each day to office. Madasamy on TVS with Milk Cans also started to sell. Ramasamy proudly said ‘Hi" to Madasamy. Madasamy with embarrassed look muttered Hi . & each attended to their  respective duties.

6 months passed .....
Ramasamy re-paid 20%  of the motorcycle purchase money.He still  had to repay ₹80K. Madasamy cleared ₹1 lakh out of his ₹2lakh borrowed money. When Both  met Ramasamy gave a small smile ,thinking of his debt of 80K. Madasamy also smiled reminiscing about his remaining loan of ₹ 1 lakh 

1 year passed by....
Ramasamy had high hopes on a salary hike. Suddenly due to recession company mailer informed all employees of no hike. half liter of milk increased  in price to ₹14/-from ₹10/-.This profited Madasamy by 30% and helped him pay the remaining₹ 1 lakh loan amount. 
By now, with difficulty Ramasamy cleared his Bike loan and took a personal loan of ₹2 lakhs @ 16% interest. Ramasamy bought furniture, LCD, LapTop with loan money. Every One applauded Ramasamy as he  had purchased these accessories in just 2 years time.Now Madasamy with his business profits  bought 12 more buffaloes. His income doubled. 

Again both met. Ramasamy gave feeble smile thinking about his Persoal loan. Madasamy gave a big smile since he was debt free.
After 2  more Years Ramasamy got a 10% salary hike. He then bought a Maruti  Wagon R car through  a Car Loan. Mean time Madasamy bought 2 acres land for his 3 dozen buffaloes. Milk Prices increased by 30% again. Now Madasamy was earning  200% more than Ramasamy. Madasamy owned one Auto to sell Milk.  
Once more both faced met. With Loans and  accruing Interest Ramasamy was unable to smile. g Madasamy smiled  merrily driving his own Auto.

2 more years passed 
Ramasamy applied for ₹40 lakhs home loan and bought an apartment. Madasamy's buffaloes numbered 126. Madasamy bought 2 apartments. Ramasamy got 10 more percent salary hike. Milk price crossed ₹ 40per liter now. Total income of Madasamy was 500 times that of Ramasamy. 
Madasamy owned 1 Skoda and 1 Innova Car. Both met again
Ramasamy grimaced struggling to clear ₹40 lakh loan. 
Madasamy smiled ear to ear since he owned a medium sized Milk Factory with more than 170 buffaloes and 25 workers.

That night Ramasamy was in deep frustration. Because after 5 years Madasamy owned ₹4 crores , had a monthly  income of 5 lakhs  & provided jobs to 25 workers.   Ramasamy's salary is 9 lakhs  p a with ₹40 lakhs debt & unbearable job dissatisfaction This was the Balance Sheet.
 
Facts: In 2008 Milk was ₹10/- litre. Now ₹40/- litre. Gold ₹12500/- 10 grams, Now ₹30000/-.  In the last 5 years salary hikes for software professionals was just 30%.  All commodity prices increased by 300%. Still most Indian parents think engineering is the only worthwhile profession for their wards.

30/06/17, 12:02 - Kampa Aunt: _*July 1 will change your world: Be prepared for changes other than GST*_

_By Satyam Sharma, ECONOMICTIMES.COM | Jun 28, 2017, 03.30 PM IST_


NEW DELHI: July 1 is set to enter into history books, and not just for the Goods and Services Tax (GST). A number of other major changes will happen from this date. 

*_Here is a list of changes that are coming into effect on July 1: _*

*No filing of I-T return without Aadhaar:* The government has made it compulsory to mention Aadhaar for filing of income tax return. Without Aadhaar, you won't be able to file your return after July 1. 

*Linking of Aadhaar with PAN becomes mandatory:* The government has also made it compulsory to link Aadhaar with PAN to stop people using multiple PANs to evade taxes. If a person does not link PAN and Aadhaar as mandated by Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, his PAN could become invalid. 

*No PAN card without Aadhaar:* Aadhaar becomes must for getting new PAN. You won't be able to get a PAN card after Saturday without your Aadhaar card. 


*No passport without Aadhaar card:* Ministry of External Affairs has listed Aadhaar card as one of the mandatory documents for applying for a passport. So you won't be able to get your passport without Aadhaar from July 1. 

*_From July 1, PAN must be linked to Aadhaar_*

*Linking PF account with Aadhaar:* Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has made it compulsory to link PF account with Aadhaar by June 30. Pensioners are also asked to furnish Aadhaar details. According to EPFO, Aadhaar linking is expected to make the withdrawal and settlement process time much shorter, from existing 20 days to 10 days. 


*No concession on railway tickets:* To plug misuse and leakages, Indian Railways have made it mandatory to quote Aadhaar from July 1 to avail concessions on railway tickets. 

*Scholarships for schools and colleges:* HRD ministry has also issued a notification that school and college students, who want to get government scholarship or are already getting it, should furnish Aadhaar details by June 30. After that, scholarships would not be given to any student who doesn't have Aadhaar. 

*No PDS benefit without Aadhaar:* Public distribution benefits have been linked to Aadhaar. Individuals will have to link Aadhaar with ration cards before July 1 to get all the PDS subsidy benefits. 

*No departure form for flyers from July 1:* Indians flying abroad will not be required to fill departure cards from July 1. The move is aimed at ensuring hassle-free movement and reducing the time required to complete immigration formalities. 

*Expat tax in Saudi Arabia from July 1:* Saudi Arabia is introducing a monthly expatriate levy on the dependents of expatriates from July 1. The fee will be 100 riyals (around Rs 1,721) per dependent this year. It will be doubled to 200 riyals per dependent from July next year, tripled to 300 riyals in 2019 and quadrupled to 400 riyals from July 2020. 

*New curriculum for CA:* Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch on July 1 a new syllabus for those studying to become chartered accountants. The new syllabus is in accordance with International education standards of the International Federation of Accountants and also includes new taxation system, the GST. 

*Online visitor visa for Indians flying to Australia:* The Australian government has announced that Indian visitors can apply for a visitor's visa online starting July 1. The online visa facility is expected to fasten the approval process. 
30/06/17, 14:01 - Arpith: What is GST and how will it affect you? All your questions answered: http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/what-is-gst-and-how-will-it-affect-you-all-your-questions-answered/article19184910.ece
30/06/17, 15:10 - Sinchana: What is GST?         Let us understand. When you were not married and came late home, you have to answer first to your sister then your mother and lastly to your father. But after your marriage you have to answer to only to your wife.    Only to one person not to the whole family members. That's GST. So simple.

03/07/17, 20:24 - Kampa Aunt: *China 🇨🇳has destroyed Indian Bunkers at Sikkim by crossing LOC of India*
*They have initiated illegal roads in connecting territory of India 🇮🇳and Bhutan🇧🇹*
*They have started using physical arm push with Indian Soldiers to leave our LOC zone, which can go any time violent as both side soldiers are at great mental stress in isolation zones, in advese weather conditions at border*
*They have stopped Kailash Mansarovar Yatra with immediate effect demanding our Soldiers to leave Sikkim LOC zone, Chinese soldiers to be allowed to destroy existing Indian Bunkers & demanded NOC of India to allow new road building by them to cover India Bhutan border zones*
*All Indians are sincerely requested to completely boycott Chinese Goods (Made in PRC - means Made in People's Republic Of China) to end all business relations and stop tourism, business tour at China* India imports around 100 billion dollars worth of goods from China which is pretty substantial. 
*If they will face set back in their economy then they will not be able to bear cost of their huge Chinese Army Operational Cost, it will be great relief to our Indian Soldiers at LOC*
*Let us show our strength and patriotism towards sovereignty of our Great Nation India* 🇮🇳 🙏🏻

11/07/17, 19:44 - Kampa Aunt: *Life Saving Kit*

1. A talk was delivered by Major General Dr. Kayani, a renowned cardiologist, on *Prevention of Heart Diseases*, at NUST.

The guest speaker introduced to the audience a very handy kit which may protect a person from dying of sudden heart attack.
It has following items :-
 *a. Tab Disprin  – 4*
 *b. Tab Angisid  – 4*
 *c. Deponit NT5 skin patch-1*

*2. The worthy professor elaborated that if one feels sudden tightness and pain in centre of chest, radiating to left arm or both sides of neck, accompanied by sweating and uneasiness, one is likely to be in a state of heart attack.* 

Following measures must be taken immediately :-
 *a. Keeping one Angisid tablet under the tongue.*
 *b. Chewing one Disprin tablet.*
 *c. Pealing of and sticking the Deponit NT5 skin patch on left side of chest.*

*3.  The items of this kit cost about Rs 50-55, without any specific expert handling but can definitely save a person from dying immediately of a heart attack.*

*4.  It is advised that every individual, above 40 years of age, must prepare a kit of his / her own and should always carry inside one’s pocket (hand-bag – in case of ladies).*

*5. Please disseminate the contents of the message to all about whom you care.*
12/07/17, 06:47 - Kampa Aunt: *Hats off to the Doctor who wrote this in his clinic for his patients.

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

My *expectations* from my *patients*.

■ Please bring your *old medical records* but *don't bring* your *opinion* about your old doctor... I am *no better* than him/her...

■ Wait *patiently* in the *queue*...

■ My phone is for *EMERGENCY*...

■ If you want, please do *wish* me when u meet me in a marriage or birthday party or a hotel but *don't* discuss your health problems there also...

■ Dont *praise* me that I saved you, because I didn't do anything *extra*, it's my *duty to treat*... It is *God* who heals, but when there is a *complication* please *understand* it's also *His wish*... Many complications, adverse effects of drugs are *not* my work... It's sometimes *your own body* which responds in a *peculiar* way...

■ If you are *not happy* with my work, *go away* to my *brother* or *sister* colleague, don't just *waste* your time...

■ Take my advice, *don't read internet* and *decide* about your *treatment*, I *don't* repair my computer seeing instructions on internet, so also you *can't* get treatment on *Google*...

■ Come *prepared* with your complaints... I am happy if you *write and bring* especially *points* and I can answer your points *well*...

■ *Don't answer your mobile* in *my cabin*, keep it on *SILENT mode* and *LISTEN to* me...

I end acknowledging that I am called a *_Doctor_ only because of you*... When you are in my cabin, you are only my *"Patient "* and *NOT* an *Officer* or *Minister* or *Media Man* or *Teacher*
and in the end I *remind* you that I too am a *_Human Being_* like you...

*Thank You*...

18/07/17, 16:54 - Kampa Aunt: *ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಪತ್ನಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ*

ಒಮ್ಮೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಮನೆಗೆ ಒಬ್ಬ ಗೆಳೆಯ ಬಂದ. ನಾನು ಅವನು ಕಾಫಿ ಕುಡಿಯುತ್ತಾ ಹರಟುತ್ತಿದ್ದೆವು. ಹಾಗೇ ಮಾತಾಡ್ತಾ ಕುಳಿತಿದ್ದಾಗ ನನಗೆ ಥಟ್ಟನೆ ನೆನಪಾಗಿ ಹೇಳಿದೆ " ಅಯ್ಯೋ ಬೆಳಿಗ್ಗೆಯಿಂದ ಪಾತ್ರೆ ತೊಳೀದೆ ಹಾಗೇ ಉಳಿದಿದೆ. ಪೇಪರ್ ಓದ್ತಾ ಇರು ಅಷ್ಟರಲ್ಲಿ ಪಾತ್ರೆ ತೊಳೆದು ಬರ್ತೀನಿ" ಅಂತ.
ನಾ ಹಾಗೆ ಹೇಳಿದ ತಕ್ಷಣ ನಾನೇನೋ ಸ್ಪೇಸ್ ರಾಕೆಟ್ ಬಿಲ್ಡ್ ಮಾಡ್ತೀನಿ ಇರು ಅಂತ ಹೇಳಿದನೇನೋ ಅನ್ನೋ ಥರಾ ಗೆಳೆಯ ವಿಚಿತ್ರವಾಗಿ ನೋಡಿದ. ಆಮೇಲೆ ನನ್ನ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಮೆಚ್ಚುಗೆಯಿಂದ ಹೇಳಿದ " ನೀನು ನಿನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡ್ತೀಯಲ್ಲ ಗುಡ್, ಒಳ್ಳೆ ಕೆಲಸ. ಆದರೆ ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ನಾನು ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡಿದಾಗ ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿ ಒಂದು ಪ್ರಶಂಸೆಯನ್ನೂ ಮಾಡಲ್ಲ. ಹೋದ ವಾರ ನೆಲ ಒರೆಸಿದೆ. ಆದರೆ ಅವಳು ಒಂದು ಥ್ಯಾಂಕ್ಸ್ ಕೂಡ ಹೇಳಲಿಲ್ಲ "

 ನಾನು ಪಾತ್ರೆ ತೊಳೆದು ವಾಪಸ್ ಅವನತ್ರ ಕುಳಿತು ಅವನಿಗೆ ಹೇಳಿದೆ. " *ನಾನು* *ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ* *ಮಾಡಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಹಾಗೆ ನೋಡಿದರೆ* *ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ* *ಮನೆಗೆಲಸದ ಸಹಾಯಕ ಅಲ್ಲ ಬೇಕಾಗಿರೋದು. ಅವಳಿಗೆ* *ಬೇಕಿರೋದು* 
 *ಸಂಗಾತಿ* " 
ನಾನು ಅವಳಿಗೆ ಒಬ್ಬ ಸಂಗಾತಿ ಆಗಿದೀನಿ.
ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಮನೆ ಕ್ಲೀನ್ ಮಾಡುವುದು ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ ಮಾಡುವ ಸಹಾಯ ಅಲ್ಲ. ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ನಾನೂ ಈ ಮನೇಲಿ ಬದುಕ್ತಿದೀನಿ, ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಮನೆ ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ನನ್ನ ಕರ್ತವ್ಯ ಕೂಡ.

ಅಡಿಗೆ ಮಾಡುವಾಗ ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ "ಸಹಾಯ" ಅಂದುಕೊಂಡು ಮಾಡಬೇಕಾಗಿಲ್ಲ.
ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ನಾನೂ ಊಟ ಮಾಡಲೇಬೇಕು. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ನಾನು ಅಡಿಗೆ ಮಾಡುವುದು ಅಥವಾ ಆಕೆಗೆ ಅಡಿಗೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಜೊತೆಯಾಗುವುದು ವಿಶೇಷ ಅಂತ ಅಂದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕಾಗಿಲ್ಲ.

ಊಟ ಆದಮೇಲೆ ಪಾತ್ರೆ ತೊಳೆಯೋದನ್ನ ಸಹಾಯ ಅಂದುಕೋಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ. ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ನಾನೂ ಆ ಪಾತ್ರೆಗಳನ್ನು ಅವಶ್ಯವಾಗಿ ಬಳಸ್ತೀನಿ.

ಮಕ್ಕಳ ಲಾಲನೆ ಪಾಲನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಅಂತ ಮಾಡಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ.
ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ಅವರು ನನ್ನ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಕೂಡ, ಮತ್ತು ಅವರ ಲಾಲನೆ ಪಾಲನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ತಂದೆಯಾಗಿ ನನ್ನ ಪಾಲೂ ಇದೆ.

ಬಟ್ಟೆ ಒಗೆಯೋ, ಇಸ್ತ್ರಿ ಮಾಡೋ ಮತ್ತು ಮಡಿಚಿಡೊ ವಿಚಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಾನು ಹೆಂಡತಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಅಂತ ಮಾಡಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ.
ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ಆ ಬಟ್ಟೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನನ್ನದೂ ಮತ್ತು ಮಕ್ಕಳದೂ ಇದೆ.
ನಾನು ಮನೇಲಿ ಒಬ್ಬ ಸಹಾಯಕ ಅಲ್ಲ. ನಿಜವಾಗಿ ನಾನೂ ನಮ್ಮ ಮನೆಯ ಭಾಗ.

ಇಷ್ಟು ಹೇಳಿ, ನನ್ನ ಗೆಳೆಯನ್ನ ಕೇಳಿದೆ " ನಿನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿ ಅಡಿಗೆ ಮಾಡಿ ಬಡಿಸಿ, ಪಾತ್ರೆ ತೊಳೆದು, ಬಟ್ಟೆ ಒಗೆದು ಮಡಿಚಿಟ್ಟು, ಮನೆ ಕ್ಲೀನ್ ಮಾಡಿ, ಮಕ್ಕಳ ಬೇಕು ಬೇಡ ಪೂರೈಸಿ, ಒಟ್ಟಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ಮನೆ ಅಂದ್ರೆ ಹೇಗಿರಬೇಕು ಅನ್ನುವಂತೆ ದಿನಾ ಮಾಡ್ತಾರಲ್ಲ, ನೀನು ಯಾವತ್ತಾದರೂ ಆಕೆಗೆ ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಥ್ಯಾಂಕ್ಸ್ ಹೇಳಿದಿಯಾ? " 

" ಥ್ಯಾಂಕ್ಸ್ ಅಂದ್ರೆ, ವಾವ್ ಸ್ವೀಟ್ ಹಾರ್ಟ್ ನೀನೊಂದು ಅದ್ಭುತ ಅನ್ನೋತರ. ನಾನು ಕೇಳ್ತಾ ಇರೋದು ನಿನಗೆ ವಿಚಿತ್ರ ಅನ್ನಿಸ್ತಿದೆ ಅಲ್ವ? ನೀನು ಯಾವತ್ತೊ ಒಂದಿನ ನೆಲ ಒರೆಸಿ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಆಕೆ ನಿನ್ನ ಪ್ರಶಂಸೆ ಮಾಡಲಿಲ್ಲ ಅಂದಿದ್ದಕ್ಕೆ ಇನ್ಮುಂದೆ ಮನೇಲಿ ಏನೂ ಮಾಡಲೇಬಾರದು ಅಂದ್ಕೊಂಡೆ ಅಲ್ವಾ? "

" ಹೀಗೆಲ್ಲಾ ಯಾಕಾಗುತ್ತೆ ಅಂದ್ರೆ, ನಮ್ಮ ಪುರುಷ ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಸಮಾಜ ಮನೆ ಬಹುತೆರಕ ಕೆಲಸಗಳು ಹೆಣ್ಣಿನದೇ ಮತ್ತು ಅವಳ ಕೈಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತ್ರ ಇದನ್ನ ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ಮಾಡಕ್ಕಾಗುತ್ತೆ ಅನ್ನೊ ಭಾವೆಯನ್ನು ನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಬೇರೂರುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿದೆ ".

" ನೀನೊಂದು ಬೆರಳು ತೋರಿಸುವಷ್ಟರಲ್ಲಿ ಮನೇಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಚಂದವಾಗಿ ನಡೆಯಬೇಕು. ಆ ರೀತಿ ನಡೆಸಬೇಕಿರೋದು ಹೆಂಡತಿ ಜವಾಬ್ದಾರಿ ಅಂತ ನಿನಗೆ ಚಿಕ್ಕಂದಿನಿಂದ ಹೇಳಿಕೊಡಲಾಗಿದೆ " 

" ನೀನು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ಯೋಚನೆ ಮಾಡೋದಾದರೆ ನೀನು ಮಾಡಿದ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಆಕೆಯಿಂದ ಹೇಗೆ ಪ್ರಶಂಸೆ ಬಯಸ್ತಿಯೋ ಹಾಗೆ ಅದೇ ಭಾವದಿಂದ ಆಕೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರಶಂಸಿಸುವ ಮನಸ್ಸು ಬೆಳೆಸಿಕೊ. ಆ ಪ್ರಶಂಸಿಸುವ ಮನಸ್ಸು ಇದ್ದಾಗ ನೀನು ನಿಜವಾದ ಸಂಗಾತಿ ಆಗ್ತೀಯ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ನಿಜವಾದ ಸಂಗಾತಿಯಾಗು".
" ಇಲ್ಲಾಂದ್ರೆ, ನೀನೊಬ್ಬ ಅತಿಥಿ ಥರಾ ಆಗ್ತೀಯ ಅಷ್ಟೆ. ಅತಿಥಿಗಳು ಬರ್ತಾರೆ, ತಿಂತಾರೆ, ಮಲಗ್ತಾರೆ ಮಾತಾಡ್ತಾರೆ. ಆಮೇಲೆ ತೃಪ್ತಿಯಾದರೆ, ಮನೆ ನಿಜವಾಗಿ ಚೆಂದದ ಮನೆಯಾಗಿ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡಿದೀರ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳಿ ಹೋಗ್ತಾರೆ"

" ನಿಂಗೆ ಅರ್ಥ ಆಯ್ತು ಅಂದುಕೋತೀನಿ. ಯಾಕಂದ್ರೆ ನೀನು ನನ್ನ ನೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಗೆಳೆಯ, ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಮನಸ್ಸಿರೋನು. ಆದರೆ ನಿನಗೆ ಬಹುತೇಕ ಗಂಡಂದಿರಂತೆ ಇದೆಲ್ಲ ಗೊತ್ತಾಗಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ ಅಷ್ಟೆ."

*ಸಮಾಜದಲ್ಲಿ ಗಂಡು ಹೆಣ್ಣಿನ ನಡುವೆ ಸಮಾನತೆ ಬರಬೇಕು ಅಂದರೆ ಅದು ಮೊದಲು ನಮ್ಮ ಮನೆ ಒಳಗೆ ಆಗಬೇಕು ಗೆಳೆಯ. ಆಗ ಅದನ್ನ ನಮ್ಮ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಕಲೀತಾರೆ* "

25/07/17, 11:51 - Kampa Aunt: 🆘🆘🆘This is from Dr. Geetha Krishnaswamy, Please give your 2min and read this:-
 

1. ⭕Let’s say it’s 7:25pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.

2. ⭕You’re really tired, upset and frustrated.


3. ⭕Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.


4. ⭕Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.


5. ⭕You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.


6. ⭕🆘HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has onlyabout 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.


7. ⭕🆘However, these victims can help themselves by 🆘coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.

🆘A breath and a 🆘cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.



8. ⭕🆘Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and 🆘🆘coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.

9. Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!


10. A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail kindly sends it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.


11. Rather than sending jokes, please..contribute by forwarding this mail which can save a person’s life…. 


12. If this message comes around you ……more than once…..please don’t get irritated……You need to be happy that you have many friends who care about you & being reminded of how to tackle….Heart Attack….AGAIN…

Dr. N Siva
(Senior Cardiologist

09/08/17, 11:07 - Kampa Aunt: Beautiful letter written by a father to his son 👌
Must send to your children

Following is a letter to his son from a renowned Hong Kong TV broadcaster and Child Psychologist.
The words are actually applicable to all of us, young or old, children or parents.! 
This applies to daughters too. All parents can use this in their teachings to their children.


Dear son ,

I am writing this to you because of 3 reasons

1. Life, fortune and mishaps are unpredictable, nobody knows how long he lives. Some words are better said early.

2. I am your father, and if I don't tell you these, no one else will.

 3. What is written is my own personal bitter experiences that perhaps could save you a lot of unnecessary heartaches. Remember the following as you go through life



 1. Do not bear grudge towards those who are not good to you. No one has the responsibility of treating you well, except your mother and I. 
To those who are good to you, you have to treasure it and be thankful, and ALSO you have to be cautious, because, everyone has a motive for every move. When a person is good to you, it does not mean he really likes you. You have to be careful, don't hastily regard him as a real friend.

2. No one is indispensable, nothing is in the world that you must possess. 
Once you understand this idea, it would be easier for you to go through life when people around you don't want you anymore, or when you lose what/who you love the most.

 3. Life is short. 
When you waste your life today, tomorrow you would find that life is leaving you. The earlier you treasure your life, the better you enjoy life.

4. Love is a transient feeling, and this feeling would fade with time and with one's mood. If your so called loved one leaves you, be patient, time will wash away your aches and sadness. 
Don't over exaggerate the beauty and sweetness of love, and don't over exaggerate the sadness of falling out of love.

 5.A lot of successful people did not receive a good education, that does not mean that you can be successful by not studying hard! Whatever knowledge you gain is your weapon in life. 
One can go from rags to riches, but one has to start from some rags!

 6.I do not expect you to financially support me when I am old, neither  would I financially support your whole life. My responsibility as a supporter ends when you are grown up. After that, you decide whether  you want to travel in a public transport or in your limousine, whether rich or poor.

7. You honour your words, but don't expect others to be so. You can be good to people, but don't expect people to be good to you. If you don't understand this, you would end up with unnecessary troubles.

 8. I have bought lotteries for umpteen years, but I could never strike any prize. That shows if you want to be rich, you have to work hard! There is no free lunch!

9. No matter how much time I have with you, let's treasure the time we have together. We do not know if we would meet again in our next life.

                 Your Dad

Read it twice
Ask your son and daughter to read it thrice.
Worth a read

Please don't be proud to be great parents when you give mobiles to you kids or when your kids operate mobiles very nicely. Actually you are unknowing pushing your kids to unwanted CANCER.

Please forward this message widely

11/08/17, 09:47 - Kampa Aunt: A Cyclist - is a disaster for the economy:

1. He does not buy the car and does not take a car loan.

2. Does not buy vehicle insurance. 

3. Does not buy fuel. 

4. Does not use the services of repair shops and car washes. 

5. Does not use paid parking. 

6. Does not become obese. 

7. Yes, and well, dammit ! Healthy people are not needed for the economy.

They do not buy drugs.

They do not go to private doctors. 

They do not increase the country's GDP !

On the contrary, every new McDonald's outlet creates 30 jobs: 

10 Dentists, 

10 Cardiologists and 

10 Weight Loss Experts.

So, what do you prefer-
 
Cycling or McDonald?

19/08/17, 05:09 - Kampa Aunt: HOW VERY TRUE!

My mum used to cut chicken, chop eggs and spread butter on bread on the same cutting board with the same knife and no bleach, but we didn't seem to get food poisoning.

Our school sandwiches were wrapped in wax paper in a brown paper bag, not in ice pack coolers, but I can't remember getting e.Coli

Almost all of us would have rather gone swimming in the lake or at the beach instead of a pristine pool (talk about boring), no beach closures then.

We all took PE ... And risked permanent injury with a pair of Dunlop sandshoes instead of having cross-training athletic shoes with air cushion soles and built in light reflectors that cost as much as a small car. I can't recall any injuries but they must have happened because they tell us how much safer we are now.

We got the cane for doing something wrong at school, they used to call it discipline yet we all grew up to accept the rules and to honour & respect those older than us.

We had 50 kids in our class and we all learned to read and write, do maths and spell almost all the words needed to write a grammatically correct letter... , FUNNY THAT!!

We all said prayers in school irrespective of our religion, sang the national anthem and no one got upset.

Staying in detention after school caught all sorts of negative attention we wish we hadn't got.

I thought that I was supposed to accomplish something before I was allowed to be proud of myself.

I just can't recall how bored we were without computers, Play Station, Nintendo, X-box or 270 digital TV cable stations. We weren't!!

Oh yeah ... And where was the antibiotics and sterilisation kit when I got that bee sting? I could have been killed!

We played "King of the Hill" on piles of gravel left on vacant building sites and when we got hurt, mum pulled out the 2/6p bottle of iodine and then we got our backside spanked.

Now it's a trip to the emergency room, followed by a 10 day dose of antibiotics and then mum calls the lawyer to sue the contractor for leaving a horribly vicious pile of gravel where it was such a threat.

To top it off, not a single person I knew had ever been told that they were from a dysfunctional family. How could we possibly have known that?

We never needed to get into group therapy and/or anger management classes. We were obviously so duped by so many societal ills, that we didn't even notice that the entire country wasn't taking Prozac!

How did we ever survive?

LOVE TO ALL OF US WHO SHARED THIS ERA.

AND TO ALL WHO DIDN'T, SORRY FOR WHAT YOU MISSED.

WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING!

Pass this to someone and remember that life's most simple pleasures are very often the best.

AAAAh, those WERE the days!!!!

09/09/17, 09:56 - Kampa Aunt: What to do if you are unable to pass urine suddenly

Recently I met a famous allopathy doctor on account of a medical article. He is in his 70s…is an ENT specialist. It was astonishing to listen to one of his experience which he shared. That day morning when he woke up he had a problem. He had an urge to pass urine but for some reason he was unable to do. At this age some people face with such problem some times and if they try two or three times they may succeed. He tried after some time but same condition. His continuous efforts didn’t bear any result. Then he realised there is some problem. Though he is a doctor but he is not an exception to such physical problems as he is also made of the same flesh and blood like everyone. Now his lower abdomen became heavy and he was unable to sit or stand and was suffering with the building pressure. Immediately he called up a known urologist on phone and explained his situation. Urologist replied “I am at present in a hospital in the outskirts and I will be coming to a clinic in your area in another one and a half hour. Will you be able to withstand that long?” He replied “I will try”. 
At that instant he received an incoming call which happened to be from another allopathy doctor from his town (Suseendharam). With great difficulty the ENT doctor explained his situation to his childhood friend doctor.  His friend echoed back “oh, your urine bladder is full and you are unable to pass urine. Don’t worry, do as I suggest, you will be able to pass urine”. And he started giving the instructions. “Stand up and jump vigorously …while jumping lift both your hands as though you are plucking the mangoes. Do like this for 15 to 20 times”. What, when the bladder is full he wants me to jump? Though little sceptical the ENT doctor started trying it. What a relief within 5 to 6 time jumping urine started passing. ENT doctor felt overjoyed and felt thankful to his childhood friend doctor for solving it with such simple solution which otherwise would have required an admission in a hospital where they would have inserted a catheter inside the bladder, injections, anti-biotics etc resulting in a bill amount crossing Rs 50,000 in addition to physical and mental stress for him and his near and dear ones.
Sharing this for the benefit of others.

20/09/17, 16:41 - Geethathe: Why millets, why not other food crops? The answers are many. Topping them all is the fact that millets are extremely eco-friendly followed by the following reasons:

1. They thrive on non-chemical agronomic practices
2. In a broad sense they are pest-free crops
Millet farming is home to agro-biodiversity
3. They do not need irrigation for their cultivation
4. They can grow on the poorest of soils
In the hands of traditional farmers, millet farming needs zero energy input
5. They offer not only food but also fodder, health, nutrition, livelihood and ecological security. Thus, while other food crops can offer us food security, millets can offer multiple securities.
20/09/17, 16:41 - Geethathe: Millets can grow without irrigation

Do you know how much water we use for growing a kilo of rice? It is an incredible 3000-4000 litres of water!

Assuming that the minimum yield of rice in a chemically-grown Green Revolution model is about 2000 kilos per acre, that acre uses between six and eight million litres of water. If, on the same field you grow millets, you can save six to eight million litres of water for the nation. Even if you price this water at one paisa a litre, a millet farmer contributes nearly Rs.60, 000 per year for every acre of the farm she/he cultivates, to the national kitty.

In a sense, millet farmers are the only ones who do not demand any subsidy from the state, on the contrary subsidise the state exchequer. Consider the fact that nearly 60 million acres of land in India are under millet cultivation. This area contributes in terms of water close to Rs. 350 billion every year to the national income as its own water cess! A contribution never discussed in the august chambers of celebrated economists at the national level. Through such silences, the millet farmers have been completely marginalised.

In that fatal accident, the driver died but his girlfriend sat in the car in shock.

The car split into two pieces without roof and doors. 

But the woman amazingly got no injury at all, seems nothing happened to her. 

Without moving, she open her bag and talked on her cellphone. 

Witnesses said she doesnt know the reality. Lucky she got no injury at all in the terrible accident.

08/10/17, 08:43 - Kampa Aunt: In 1919, flu killed 40 million people. 

A doctor visited the many farmers who had the attack to see if he could help them combat the flu. 

Many of the farmers & their family had contracted the flu and many died.

However, the doctor came upon one farmer whose family was healthy and nobody in the house contracted the flu.

The doctor asked the farmer what he was doing that was different from the others. 

The farmer's wife replied that she put an unpeeled onion in a dish and placed them in all the rooms in their house.

The doctor thought that could have been the cure so he asked for one of those onions.

As he placed it under the microscope, he found the flu virus in the onion. The onions obviously absorbed all the bacteria and thereby kept the family healthy.

Now, I sent this story to a friend in Oregon who regularly contributes material to me on health issues. She replied with this most interesting experience about onions:

She said ' Thanks for the reminder. I don't know about the farmer's story but, I do know that I myself got pneumonia and became very ill. From my previous knowledge about onions, I  cut both ends off an onion put it into an empty jar, and place the jar next to myself over night. 

By the morning, I began to feel better while the onion became black.'

Lots of times when we have stomach problems we don't know what to blame. Maybe the onions that we ate earlier are to blame.

*Onions ABSORB BACTERIA* and that is the reason why they are so good at preventing us from getting *colds & flu* 

And for that very reason we should NOT eat an onion that has been sitting for a time after it has *been cut open.*

*Left over onions are poisonous*

When food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is whether the 'victim'  ate *ONIONS* and where those onions came from. Most probably the *ONIONS,* are the cause.

*Onions are huge magnets* for bacteria, especially uncooked ones.

*Never ever keep a portion of sliced onion over a period of time and thereafter use it to prepare food. It's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and placed it in your refrigerator. It is still poisonous* 

Also, do not give onions to dogs. Their stomachs cannot metabolize onions.

*Please remember it is dangerous to cut an onion and try to save it to cook with the next day, it becomes highly poisonous for even a single night - as it creates toxic bacteria which causes adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning.*

Let as many as possible people know this.

ಈಗ ಕುತ್ತಿಗೆ ನೋವು ಹಲವರಲ್ಲಿ ಕಂಡುಬರುತ್ತಿದೆ. ನರಮಂಡಲದ ಮೂಲ ನರಗಳು ಪಾದ ಮತ್ತು ಅಂಗೈನಲ್ಲೂ ಸಹ ಇರುವುದರಿಂದ ಪಾದವನ್ನು ಹದಿನೈದು ನಿಮಿಷಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಬಿಸಿನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಅದ್ದಿಕೊಂಡರೆ ಕುತ್ತಿಗೆ ನೋವು ಮತ್ತು ಕುತ್ತಿಗೆಯ ಸೆಳೆತಗಳು ಮಾಯವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

*4. ಒತ್ತಡದ ನಿವಾರಣೆ:*

ಬಿಸಿ ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನಮ್ಮ ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ಸುಮಾರು ಹದಿನೈದು ನಿಮಿಷಗಳ ಹೊತ್ತು ಅದ್ದಿಕೊಂಡು ಕುಳಿತುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದರಿಂದ ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿ ರಕ್ತ ಪರಿಚಲನೆ ಚುರುಕುಗೊಂಡು ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಮತ್ತು ದೈಹಿಕ ಒತ್ತಡವು ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

*5. ತಲೆನೋವು ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ :*

ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನ ಬಿಸಿ ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸುಮಾರು ಹದಿನೈದು ನಿಮಿಷಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಅದ್ದಿದಾಗ ಪಾದಕ್ಕೆ ರಕ್ತ ಸಂಚಾರ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗುವುದರಿಂದ ಕತ್ತಿನ ಮತ್ತು ಬೆನ್ನಿನ ಸ್ನಾಯುಗಳು ಸಡಿಲವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಒತ್ತಡದಿಂದ ಉಂಟಾದ ತಲೆನೋವು ದೂರವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

*6. ನಿದ್ರಾಹೀನತೆಯನ್ನು ಹೋಗಲಾಡಿಸುತ್ತದೆ :*

ರಾತ್ರಿ ನೀವು ಮಲಗುವ ಮುಂಚೆ ಹದಿನೈದು ನಿಮಿಷಗಳ ಕಾಲ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಪಾದವನ್ನು ಬಿಸಿನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಅದ್ದಿಕೊಂಡು ಕುಳಿತುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದರಿಂದ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಒತ್ತಡ ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗಿ ನಿಮ್ಮ ನಿದ್ರಾ ಹೀನತೆಯ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗೆ ಪರಿಹಾರ ತಂದುಕೊಟ್ಟು ಮತ್ತು ನಿದ್ರೆಯು ಚನ್ನಾಗಿ ಬರುತ್ತದೆ

*7. ಹಿಮ್ಮಡಿ ನೋವಿಗೆ ಪರಿಹಾರ :*

ನೀವು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಕೆಲಸಮಾಡಿದಾಗ ನಿಮಗೆ ಹಿಮ್ಮಡಿ ನೋವು ಬರುವುದು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯ. ಈ ರೀತಿ ಹಿಮ್ಮಡಿ ನೋವು ಬಂದಾಗ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಎರಡು ಪಾದಗಳನ್ನು ಬಿಸಿನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಅದ್ದಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದರಿಂದ ಹಿಮ್ಮ ನೋವು ಬಹು ಬೇಗ ಮಾಯವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

27/10/17, 13:03 - Kampa Aunt: What Time Should You Sleep??
By James Pang

Is there a best time to sleep? There is a saying that sleeping early and waking up early is good for your health. How true is that? Is it alright to sleep late and wake up late?

You actually have an amazing biological clock ticking inside your body. It is very precise. It helps to regulate your various body functions including your sleeping time.

From 11pm to 3am, most of your blood circulation concentrates in your liver. Your liver gets larger when filled with more blood. This is an important time when your body undergoes detoxification process. Your liver neutralizes and breaks down body toxins accumulated throughout the day.

However if you don't sleep at this time, your liver cannot carry out this detoxification process smoothly.

·         If you sleep at 11pm, you have full 4 hours to detoxify your body.
·         If you sleep at 12am, you have 3 hours.
·         If you sleep at 1am, you have 2 hours.
·         And if you sleep at 2am, you only have 1 Hr to detoxify.
What if you sleep after 3am? Unfortunately, you won't have any time to actually detoxify your body. If you continue with this sleeping pattern, these toxins will accumulate in your body over time. You know what happens next.

What if you sleep late and wake up late?

Have you tried going to bed very late at night? Did you realize you feel very tired the next day no matter how much you sleep ?

Sleeping late and waking up late is indeed very bad for your health. Besides not having enough time to detoxify your body, you will miss out other important body functions too.

From 3am to 5am, most blood circulation concentrates in your lung. What should you do at this moment? Well, you should exercise and breathe in fresh air. Take in good energy into your body, preferably in a garden. At this time, the air is very fresh with lots of beneficial negative ions.

From 5am to 7am, most blood circulation concentrates in your large intestine. What should you do at this moment? You should poop! Pass out all unwanted poop from your large intestine. Prepare your body to absorb more nutrients throughout the day.

From 7am to 9am, most blood circulation concentrates in your stomach. What should you do at this moment? Have your breakfast! This is your most important meal in a day. Make sure you have all the required nutrients from your breakfast. Not having breakfast causes lots of health problems for you in the future.

That's the way to start your day

No wonder people living in villages or in farms are healthier. They sleep early and wake up early as they  follow their natural biological clock.

If one follows this you're sure to feel fresher and more energetic all day long.

PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO OUR YOUNGER GENERATION THEY NEED TO KNOW THESE FACTS !!!

This was  a Hindu Temple constructed during Chalukyas period (AD 1026-1027). Tajmahal is nothing compared to this great temple. 

This marvelous structure is situated at Modara Village in Mehasana District of Gujarat.

This is constructed at the Bank of Pushpavathi River by the then Chalukyas King Bhima 1.

Now no ritual performance of Pooja or prayer happening at this place and this structure is considered as a Monument by government. 

Have you ever heard about this archeological importance structure and we never get such information because it was a Hindu Temple and it is in India. Please see the structure below👇

01/11/17, 14:57 - Kampa Aunt: 👋5 Cell Phone Tricks! 👻

1. Emergency Services: If you find yourself out of the coverage area of your mobile network and there is an emergency, just dial 112 and your mobile will establish your contact with any existing network in that area! Surprisingly, the emergency number 112 can be dialed even if the keypad is locked! 
This works on all phones worldwide and is free, too!!

2. Locked your keys in the car:
If you lock your remote keyless car keys in the car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their mobile phone from your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the person at your home press the unlock button on the spare key, holding it near the mobile phone on his/ her end. Your car will unlock, even if you are thousands of miles away!!

3. In case of mobile phone battery flat:

 All cell phones have Hidden Battery Power.
To activate, press the keys *3370# (remember the asterisk). Do this when the phone is almost dead. Your mobile will restart in a special way with this new reserve and it will show a 50% increase in battery life. This reserve will be recharged when you charge your handphone next time. This secret is in the fine print in most phone manuals, which we often skip without realizing! 

4. Disabling a STOLEN mobile:

To check your mobile phone's serial number, key in following digits on your phone: 
*#06#. A 15 digits code will appear on the screen that is unique to your handset. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. If your handphone is ever stolen, phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset so even if the SIM is changed, your handphone will be totally useless. Maybe you don't get your phone back but it can't be used/ resold either. 
This secret is in the fine print of most mobile phone manuals. It was created for the very purpose of trying to prevent phones from being stolen. 

5. ATM PIN Number Reversal:

If you ever be forced by a robber to withdraw money from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your PIN # in reverse order. For example, if your PIN Number is 1234 but you should instead put 4321. The ATM system recognizes that your PIN # is backwards from the ATM card you placed in the machine. The machine will still give you the money you requested for but unknown to the robber, the police will be immediately dispatched to the location. Beware all ATM’s carry this emergency sequencer by law. It is, however, seldomly used as people just don't know about it!! ⚠

Pass this info to family & friends!😇

4. After this he lodges a mobile theft complaint in a police station.

5. With the duplicate pancard he gets another simcard from the mobile company. 

6. Through internet banking he is now ready to access your account. 

7. He goes to the site and uses the forgot my password option.

8. Now he easily gets past other options and gets the  Internet banking pin on his simcard. 

This information was issued by the Cyber Cell Police.

 All those who used Net Banking are requested to edit Facebook profile and delete the birth date and mobile no. as a safety measure.                    Pl share to as many people as possible .

*Value LIFE Not DEATH*

*1. We care more for the dead than we do for the living!*

*2. We spend more to bury a person than we do to save their life.*

*3. We will not travel to go see a sick relative but will travel to bury him /her*

*4. People will rarely respect you while alive but will want to "pay their last respects" to your casket.*

*5. A person may NEVER receive roses in their entire life but they will get lots dumped on their graveyard!*

*6. We will spend a night at a neighbour's funeral and it will be our first time to see the inside of their house!*

*7. No one cares to know your community until you die and they will all fill car after car to "escort" your corpse*

*8. We will take the dead to the mosque/temple/church, knowing fully well they had nothing to do with God while alive.*

*9. We might not have granite tops in our kitchens but use the granite in the graveyard!*

*10. A person may under no circumstances be able to afford a limousine ride when alive but will be driven in one when dead!*

We have a culture of "hypocrisy"
... a culture that is "Pro-death" and NOT "Pro-life!"*

*We need to Value LIFE BEFORE DEATH.*

*Please love people while they are alive, show them your kindness when they need it,  your presence at their funeral will never make up for your absence when they needed you. Do it now rather than regret later.*

*This got me thinking*

11/11/17, 12:21 - Geethathe: The end of private healthcare system in Karnataka 

The government of Karnataka is about to implement the KPME act to control the doctors in the state, in the upcoming assembly session. It’s all handi work of the health minister Mr Ramesh, who has a personal grudge against all doctors in the state. 
Most common people are being misled in to believing that this is a good bill for the people and will benefit them. Without an understanding in to what exactly is happening, people are lauding the effort by the government. The doctors have already had several protests and are on the verge of an indefinite strike. The entire private medical fraternity is on the verge of collapse. 
I’m writing this just to give you a fair idea as to what’s happening. 
Let’s start with a plate of idli sambar. A plate of idli sambar costs ₹5 in a roadside shop, ₹10 in Indira canteen, ₹20 in a small Hotel , ₹ 50 in a big restaurant, ₹ 100 in a Ac restaurant in Bamgalore and may be say ₹ 300 plus taxes at any 5 start Hotel. Now if the government passes a resolution saying all these establishments have to sell a plate of idli sambar at ₹5 irrespective of the type of establishment, failing which action will be taken against the establishments. Add to that, if the idli sambar doesn’t taste good, and the customer is not satisfied, the person selling the idli sambar will be sent to jail and a fine ranging from 30,000 to a few lakhs. What will the establishments do?? Do you think a 5 star hotel will be able to sell idli sambar at ₹5?? They will eventually close down as they will not have revenue to run the place. 
This is what the bill aims to do to the private medical practitioners. The government wants to fix the prices of all services, which is next to impossible for the private establishments to survive. 
A 10th grade fail plumber who comes home to change a leaking tap, or a small job charges around ₹300 as his charges, cost of spares etc and if the house is far off he will put his travel charges as well. And you expect someone who has worked hard all his way to graduation and then post graduation and other specialisation and put in almost 15 years learning his skill to charge ₹50 as consultation and surgeries at a pittance?? 
Sincere advise to the government is to first get the government hospital mess right, appoint all positions vacant for specialists and then see the change. They can’t change their own system but want to control the professionals who are doing a good job, without any aid from the government and also paying all kinds of charges levied by the Govt like the pollution board charges, medical waste disposal, registration of clinics every now and then by paying the fees, the rent, overheads etc. 
people, please understand, doctors are not monsters. We are giving top notch healthcare in the whole world at 1/10th of the price anywhere in the developed world. The health system in our country is run by private practitioners amounting to almost 70%. So if this draconian law is going to be implemented, I can assure most doctors will be forced to change profession!! The health care system will collapse!!

13/11/17, 12:47 - Kampa Aunt: Birla Public School, Doha Principal A. P. Sharma's class on parenting:

1) Mothers - please give your child a glass of water after returning from school everyday and ask him how his day was. (Even if his clothes are soiled, treat nicely).

2) Fathers - please fix an appointment with child and talk to him or let him talk to you everyday for at least 10 mins. (This improves speech and the ability to recollect things).

3) Parents - never argue, shout or fight with each other in front of the child.(He will learn that fighting is the best solution to solve a problem).

4) Provide a healthy and compulsory breakfast in the morning itself. (Don't make it brunch please).

5) Educate your child regarding "good and bad touch". Make him/her feel free to reveal if something goes wrong with him/her.

6) Don't let your maid  change clothes or give a bath to a school going child. (Maintain privacy always).

7) Ask your child to stand in front of a mirror and hold his tie and say "I am the best" everyday. ( This improves self-confidence).

8) Children reciprocate what you give them - say   "good ", they will be "very good ". If you say "very good " he/she will be excellent. 

9) Don't consider your child  a stage performer to perform in front of guests. (They will be more shy and get guest phobia).

10) Never talk bad about your child's teacher (s) or school in front of them. (This will create a bad attitude towards the teachers/school).

11) Ask the opinion and suggestions of your child while taking decisions whenever possible. (This improves self-esteem).

15/11/17, 09:56 - Kampa Aunt: Scam at the international airport - it is happening all over the world..

Recently, an Indian was detained in Bangkok for stealing a box of cigarettes in a duty-free shop in Bangkok International Airport . He had paid for chocolates and a carton of cigarettes. The cashier put a packet of cigarettes extra into his bag and he thought it was a free pack.  He was arrested for shop-lifting and the Thai Police extortion price was 30,000 Baht for his release.   He spent two nights in jail and paid 500 Baht for an air-conditioned cell, 200-300 baht for each visitor and 11,000 baht for his final release.   The Police shared the money in front of his eyes. On top of that, he was charged in court and fined 2,000 baht by the magistrate and handcuffed and escorted to his plane.  His passport was stamped "Thief". While there, his relatives requested help from the Indian Embassy and were told that embassy is helpless. Many Asians are victimized similarly daily and letters and phone-calls to Thai authorities are ignored.   He shared a cell with a Singaporean the first night who paid 60,000 baht for his release. The second night was a Malaysian national who paid 70,000 baht. Mind you this was not in a shanty shop in downtown Bangkok but in a duty free shop at the Bangkok Int'l Airport . BE WARNED. The above is 100% correct information because Mr Rajan Khera's customer from India faced exactly the same scenario mentioned above when he was in transit at Bangkok Int'l Airport coming to Taipei. Someone who went through the same ordeal in Dubai . He bought stuff at the Duty Free upon entering. The girl at Duty Free put a bottle of cologne in his shopping bag (he did not even see it happen). He was arrested for stealing (this is before he even picked up his luggage). He sat at the airport jail where he was harassed for the whole day. NO FOOD, NO WATER for one day and only after he paid a fine (bribe of US 500...). That is all the cash he had in his pocket at the time. They let him go.!! These are scams happening all over the place. Please BE CAREFUL! All of this is pre-planned and the people who work at the airport know whom to target. Unbelievable but apply caution.... the duty free employees intentionally put extra items to Trap the passengers.....  

ALWAYS TAKE A RECEIPT FOR ANY FREE GIFT THAT THE DUTY FREE SHOP GIVES. PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND WATCHFUL.... PLZ DO NOT HURRY.  MAKE SURE to CHECK WHEN YOU ARE BEING ' BILLED '...AND ...ALSO WHEN THE ITEMS ARE  'PACKED ' IN INTERNATIONAL AIR PORTS (DUTY FREE SHOPS).  Please Pass this info to Others. Before Holiday season.... Or... Before they go on Official Duties ABROAD...

Anywhere across the WORLD.  You may save someone and their family terrible agony.

15/11/17, 21:21 - Kampa Aunt: *15 FACTS ABOUT VITAMIN D*

Vitamin D prevents Osteoporosis,
Depression,
Prostate cancer,
Breast cancer
and even effects -
Dabetes & Obesity..

Vitamin D is perhaps the single most *underrated nutrient* in the world of nutrition. 

That's probably because it's free....
Your body makes it when sunlight touches your skin !!

Drug companies can't sell you sunlight, so there's no promotion of its health benefits..

The truth is, most people don't know the real story on 
*vitamin D and health.*
 So here's an overview taken from an interview between Mike Adams and *Dr.Michael Holick*.

◆ 1. Vitamin D is *produced by your skin* in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation *from natural sunlight*. 

◆ 2. The healing rays of natural sunlight (that generate vitamin D in your skin) *cannot penetrate glass*. 
So you don't generate vitamin D when sitting in your car or home. 

◆ 3. It is nearly impossible to get adequate amounts of vitamin D from your diet. *Sunlight exposure is the only reliable way* to generate vitamin D in your own body. 

◆ 4. A person would have to drink *ten tall glasses* of vitamin D fortified milk each day just to get minimum levels of vitamin D into their diet. 

◆ 5. The further you live from the equator, the longer exposure you need to the sun in order to generate vitamin D. Canada, the UK and most U.S. States are far from the equator. 

◆ 6. People with dark skin pigmentation may need 20 - 30 times as much exposure to sunlight as fair-skinned people to generate the same amount of vitamin D. 
That's why prostate cancer is epidemic among black men -- it's a simple, but widespread, sunlight deficiency. 

◆ 7. Sufficient levels of vitamin D are *crucial for calcium absorption* in your intestines. Without sufficient vitamin D, your body cannot absorb calcium, rendering calcium supplements useless. 

◆ 8. Chronic vitamin D *deficiency cannot be reversed overnight*: it takes months of vitamin D supplementation and sunlight exposure to rebuild the body's bones and nervous system. 

◆ 9. Even weak *sunscreens (SPF=8) block* your body's ability to generate vitamin D by 95%. This is how sunscreen products actually cause disease -by creating a critical vitamin deficiency in the body. 

◆ 10. It is impossible to generate too much vitamin D in your body from sunlight exposure: your body will self-regulate and only generate what it needs. 

◆ 11. If it hurts to press firmly on your sternum(chest/breast bone), you may be suffering from chronic vitamin D deficiency right now. 

◆ 12. Vitamin D is "activated" in your body by your *kidneys and liver* before it can be used. 

◆ 13. Having kidney disease or liver damage can greatly impair your body's ability to activate circulating vitamin D. 

◆ 14. The sunscreen industry doesn't want you to know that your body actually needs sunlight exposure because that realization would mean lower sales of sunscreen products. 

◆ 15. Even though vitamin D is one of the *most powerful healing chemicals in your body*, your body makes it absolutely free. No prescription required. 

~ Other powerful *antioxidants* with this ability include the 
super fruits like Pomegranates (POM Wonderful juice), 
Acai, Blueberries, etc. 

~ Diseases and conditions cause by vitamin D deficiency:

● Osteoporosis is commonly caused by a lack of vitamin D, which greatly impairs calcium absorption. 

● Sufficient vitamin D prevents 
prostate cancer, 
breast cancer, 
ovarian cancer,
depression, 
colon cancer and
schizophrenia..

● "Rickets" is the name of a bone-wasting disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. 

● Vitamin D deficiency may *exacerbate* type 2 diabetes and impair insulin production in the pancreas.
 
● Obesity impairs vitamin D utilization in the body, meaning obese people *need twice* as much vitamin D. 

● Vitamin D is used around the world to treat *Psoriasis*(a chronic skin disease).
 
● Vitamin D deficiency can cause ~
schizophrenia. 

● Seasonal Affective Disorder is caused by a melatonin imbalance initiated by lack of exposure to sunlight. 

● Chronic vitamin D deficiency is often misdiagnosed as *fibromyalgia* because its symptoms are so similar: *muscle weakness, aches and pains*. 

● Your risk of developing serious diseases like diabetes and cancer is *reduced 50% - 80%*  through simple, sensible exposure to natural *sunlight 2-3 times each week*. 

● Infants who receive vitamin D supplementation (2000 units daily) have an *80% reduced risk* of developing *type 1 diabetes* over the next twenty years. 

  
💥 Shocking Vitamin D deficiency statistics:

¶ 32% of doctors and med school students are vitamin D deficient. 
¶ 40% of the U.S. population is vitamin D deficient. 
¶ 42% of African American women of childbearing age are deficient in vitamin D. 
¶ 48% of young girls (9-11 years old) are vitamin D deficient. 
¶ Up to 60% of all hospital patients are vitamin D deficient.
¶ 76% of pregnant mothers are severely vitamin D deficient, causing widespread vitamin D deficiencies in their unborn children, which predisposes them to type 1 diabetes, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia later in life. 81% of the children born to these mothers were deficient. 
¶ Up to 80% of nursing home patients are
vitamin D deficient❗❗

15/11/17, 21:45 - Kampa Aunt: *Chappaties will soon become EXTINCT*


A renowned cardiologist explains how eliminating wheat can IMPROVE your health.

Cardiologist William Davis, MD, started his career repairing damaged hearts through angioplasty and bypass surgeries.

“That’s what I was trained to do, and at first, that’s what I wanted to do,” he explains. But when his own mother died of a heart attack in 1995, despite receiving the best cardiac care, he was forced to face nagging concerns about his profession.

"I’d fix a patient’s heart, only to see him come back with the same problems. It was just a band-aid, with no effort to identify the *cause* of the disease.”

So he moved his practice toward highly uncharted medical territory 
– prevention – and spent the next 15 years examining the causes of heart disease in his patients.

The resulting discoveries are revealed in 
"Wheat Belly", his New York Times best-selling book, which attributes many of our physical problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity, to our consumption of wheat.
Eliminating wheat can “transform our lives.”

*What is a “Wheat Belly”?*
Wheat  raises your blood sugar dramatically. In fact, two slices of wheat bread raise your blood sugar more than a Snickers bar. 

"When my patients give up wheat,  weight loss was substantial, especially from the abdomen. People can lose several inches in the first month."
You make connections between wheat and a host of other health problems. 

Eighty percent of my patients had diabetes or pre-diabetes. 

I knew that wheat spiked blood sugar more than almost anything else, so I said,  “Let’s remove wheat from your diet and see what happens to your blood sugar.” They’d come back 3 to 6 months later, and their blood sugar would be dramatically reduced.
But they also had all these other reactions: 
“I removed wheat and I lost 38 pounds.” Or, “my asthma got so much better, I threw away two of my inhalers.” 
Or “the migraine headaches I’ve had every day for 20 years stopped within three days.” “My acid reflux is now gone.” 
“My IBS is better, my ulcerative colitis, my rheumatoid arthritis, my mood, my sleep . . .” and so on, and so on".

When you look at the makeup of wheat, Amylopectin A, a chemical unique to wheat, is an incredible trigger of small LDL particles in the blood – the number one cause of heart disease.

When wheat is removed from the diet, these small LDL levels plummet by 80 and 90 percent.

Wheat contains high levels of Gliadin, a protein that actually stimulates appetite. Eating wheat increases the average person’s calorie intake by 400 calories a day.     

Gliadin also has opiate-like properties which makes it "addictive".
Food scientists have known this for almost 20 years.

Is eating a wheat-free diet the same as a gluten-free diet? 
Gluten is just one component of wheat. 
If we took the gluten out of it, wheat will still be bad since it will still have the Gliadin and the Amylopectin A, as well as several other undesirable components.

Gluten-free products  are made with 4 basic ingredients: corn starch, rice starch, tapioca starch or potato starch. 
And those 4 dried, powdered starches are some of the  foods that raise blood sugar even higher.

I encourage people to return to REAL food: 
Fruits
Vegetables 
and nuts and seeds,  Unpasteurized cheese , 
Eggs and meats

Wheat really changed in the 70s and 80s due to a series of techniques used to increase yield, including hybridization. It was bred to be shorter and sturdier and also to have more Gliadin, (a potent appetite stimulant) 

The wheat we eat today is not the wheat that was eaten 100 years ago.

If you stop eating breads/pasta/chapatis every day, and start eating rice with chicken and vegetables, you still lose weight because rice doesn’t raise blood sugar as high as wheat, and it also doesn’t have the aAmylopectin A or the Gliadin that stimulates appetite. You won’t have the same increase in calorie intake that wheat causes. 
That’s part of the reason why foreign cultures that don’t consume wheat tend to be slenderer and healthier. 

Everyone should stop eating wheat. This is the closest I know of to something that will transform your life."
16/11/17, 07:40 - Geethathe: IIT Kanpur has develped a website on our treasures of Vedas, Shahstras etc. Finally someone from today's science & technology field, is digging into what has already been done many many years ago. 

Check it out: https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/

No issue of language as IITK smartly put each Sholka in various languages. Most amazingly, commentary on each sholka by various scholars has also been provided. When you click on Hindi translation and select the language as Tamil, it automatically translate everything into Tamil. Good use of technology.

Please share this as much as u can.

06/12/17, 16:29 - Kampa Aunt: *Why our children are so bored , cannot concentrate on study, cannot wait, get easily frustrated and have no REAL friends*

Children are getting worse in  many aspects. 
We  have seen and continue to see a decline in children’s social, emotional, academic functioning, as well as a sharp increase in learning disabilities, depression and aggression.

Today’s children come to school emotionally unavailable for learning and many factors in our modern lifestyle contribute to this.

1. *Technology*

“Free babysitting service"
Compared to virtual reality, everyday life is boring. When kids come to the classroom, they are exposed to human voices and inadequate visual stimulation as opposed to being bombarded with graphic explosions and special effects that they are used to seeing on the screens. After hours of virtual reality, they are  unable to process lower levels of stimulation. Technology also hinders parents' emotional availability.

*Limit the use of technology.*
*Have fun times together. Go for a picnic, trekking, a walk in the garden....*

2.  *Instant Gratification*.

Kids get everything they want the moment they want.

“I am Hungry!!”
Here is the ready snack (packets of junk)
“I am Thirsty!”
Here is the drink (bottle of soft drink). “I am bored!”
Use my phone. Watch TV.
The ability to delay gratification is one of the key factors for future success. We have all the best  intentions in mind to make our children happy, but unfortunately, we make them happy at that moment but miserable in the long term. 
To be able to delay gratification means to be able to function under stress.
Our children are gradually becoming less equipped to deal with even minor stressors and "frustrations " which eventually become huge obstacles to their success in life.

*Teach the kids to delay gratification. Do not give in to demands INSTANTLY unless it is urgent*.

3. *Kids' rule*

“My son doesn’t like vegetables”
" He doesn’t like going to bed early” “He doesn’t like to eat breakfast”
“He doesn’t like toys, but she is very good at his IPAD” .....
Children dictate parents.
If we leave it to them, all they are going to do is eat pasta, noodles, pizza and chips,  watch TV, play on their tablets/smartphones and never go to bed.
We are giving them what they WANT even when we know that it is not GOOD for them.
Without proper nutrition and a good night’s sleep, our kids go to school irritable, anxious, and inattentive. 
In order to achieve our goals,  we have to do what NEEDS to be done.
If a child wants to be an 'A' student, he *needs* to study hard.
If he wants to be a successful soccer player, he needs to practice every day. Our children know very well what they WANT  but not what is NEEDED to achieve that goal. This results in unattainable goals that leaves the kids disappointed.

*Teach the difference between WANT & NEED*

4. *ONLY Fun*

We have  created a fun world for our children.
Endless Activites!! There are no dull moments. The moment it becomes quiet, we run to entertain them again because otherwise we feel that we are not doing our parenting duty. 
Why aren’t children helping us in the kitchen or with laundry? Why don’t they tidy up their cupboards? This is basic monotonous work that trains the brain to work and function under “boredom”.

Teach them to do "boring" chores like folding the laundry, setting the table, tidying up after meals, packing and unpacking their own bags....

Let them have unstructured time.

Set limits.
*Make schedules for meals, sleep, study,  outdoor play, technology usage....*

5. *Limited social interaction*

Kids used to play outside, where in the  unstructured, natural environment, they learned and practiced their social skills. 
Competition (tuition/coaching), Structured Activites (painting, music, karate, zumba, etc) and  Technology replaced the outdoor time. 
Successful people have great social skills.
Social skills have to be learned and practiced just like other skills.
 *Teach them social skills, (manners, cooperation, team work, ...)*

*We are responsible for creating the next generation of healthy, happy and successful people.*

18/12/17, 22:28 - Mummy: ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳು ತವರಿಗ್ಯಾಕೆ ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ?

ಏನನ್ನೂ ಕೊಂಡುಹೋಗಲು
ಬರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.

ಅವರ ಬೇರುಗಳಿಗೆ
ನೀರೆರೆಯಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ಅಣ್ಣತಮ್ಮಂದಿರ ಸುಖ
ಸಂತೋಷವನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ
ಆನಂದಿಸಲು ..
ತಮ್ಮ ಮಧುರ ಬಾಲ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹುಡುಕಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ತವರು ಮನೆಯ ಅಂಗಳದಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ನೇಹದ ದೀಪ ಬೆಳಗಿಸಿಡಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಯಾರ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ದೃಷ್ಟಿಯೂ ಬೀಳದಂತೆ
ಬಾಗಿಲಿಗೆ ರಕ್ಷೆ ಕಟ್ಟಲು
ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಮಮತೆಯ ಝರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ
ಮಿಂದು ಹೋಗಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ತಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿರುವುದೇನನ್ನೋ
ಕೊಟ್ಟುಹೋಗಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ತಿರುಗಿ ಅತ್ತೆ ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೊರಟಾಗ
ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಅಲ್ಲೇ ಬಿಟ್ಟು
ಹೊರಡುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಎಲ್ಲರ ಮಂಜಾದ ಕಣ್ಣುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ
ತಮ್ಮ ನಸುನಗೆಯನ್ನು
ಈಜಲು ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ಅತೀ ಚಂಚಲ, ಅತಿ ಉತ್ಸಾಹದ
ಚಿಲುಮೆ ಆಗಿರುತ್ತಾಳೆ ಮಗಳು.
ಕೋಮಲ ಮನಸ್ಸಿನ ಮುಗ್ಧ
ಮಗಳು.. ಮಾತು ಮಾತಿಗೂ
ಅಳುವವಳು,.
ದೇವರ ಕೃಪೆಯಿಂದಷ್ಟೇ
ಹುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಾಳವಳು.

ಅವಳ ನಗುವಿಂದಲೇ
ಮನೆ ಸುಗಂಧಿತ..
ಪರರ ಮನೆಗೆ ಕಳುಹಿಸುವಾಗ
ಏನೋ ವಿಚಿತ್ರ ಸಂಕಟ.
ಮನೆ ಭಣಗುಟ್ಟಿಸಿ
ಎಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಅಳಿಸಿ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ

ತಾಯಿಯ ಪ್ರತಿಬಿಂಬ..
ತಂದೆಯ ಮುದ್ದಿನ 
ಕಣ್ಮಣಿ...
ದೇವರೇ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾನಂತೆ..
ತಾನು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಸಂತೋಷದಿಂದಿರುವಾಗ
ಹುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಾರೆ ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.

👆👩🏼👏�ನಮ್ಮ ಗುಂಪಿನ ಎಲ್ಲ ಮುದ್ದು ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗಾಗಿ👆�👩🏼👏

27/12/17, 22:41 - Mummy: A urologist in London had a leak in his bathroom on a Sunday. He called a plumber who charged him a £50 call out fee plus another £100 for fixing the problem in 15 minutes. 
The urologist was shocked and said to the plumber - I am a Urologist and I fix human water works and I don't get paid this much. 
The plumber replied - I know - that is why I quit Urology and took up plumbing! 
No risk, no Litigation, More money, taps don't bleed and you don't need an anaesthetist ! 🤣🤣

07/01/18, 07:03 - Kampa Aunt: Keep forwarding  this important reminder of the day: 

*NO PHONES IN KITCHEN PLEASE*
Do you make calls or receive calls in your kitchen? My name is Dr. Ademola. Just 3 days ago my husband who also is a doctor shared the sad incidents of 6 individuals who were brought into the casualty department for burns injury which they sustained while making or receiving phone calls in the kitchen with the gas burner ON. Even microwave oven or induction stoves could be dangerous. Some of them cook with the phone pressed against their ears! Please stop making or receiving calls in the kitchen. It is as dangerous as making or receiving calls in a petrol station. " Please don't forget to notify your loved ones". If the call is very urgent then move away from the gas
 by 10-12 feet distance and then take the call. Remember that your safety is your family's safety as well.
If this information is useful to you. Please don't lock it up in your phone. Spread the good news . thanks

23/01/18, 17:19 - Kampa Aunt: *Everyone should share this useful information on saving lives! It's a way to do good*!

Please pass this on, as it is not only teach other people, but could save yourself too!

Ways to save a life:

1. *Choking - Just lift up your arms.*
In New Jersey, US, a 5 years old boy, cleverly saved his grandmother's life, with a very simple method, by raising the arms! 
His 56 years old grandma Dilihua was at home watching TV while eating fruits. 
When she turned her head, a piece of fruit got stuck in her throat. She tried to press on her chest to dislodge it, but it doesn't help. When the boy asked: "Grandma, are you choking?", she could not answer. 
"I think you are choking Grandma, raise your hands, raise your hands."
The Grandma did as he said, and really managed to spit out the fruit! 
Her grandson was very calm, and said it was something he learned in school.

2. *Body aches upon waking.*
Do you wake up in the morning and find yourself experiencing body aches? Does your neck feel sore and painful? What should you do if you experience these symptoms?
Just lift your feet up!
Pull your big toes outwards, and slowly massage and rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction!

3. *Foot/Leg Cramps.*
When you have a cramp in your left foot, raise your right arm as high as possible. 
When you have a cramp in your right foot, raise your left arm. This will soothe immediately.

4. *Feet Numbness*.
If your left foot becomes numb, swing your your right hand out forcefully.
If your right foot is numb, then swing your left hand.

【Three rescue methods】

1. *Half Body Paralysis*.(regardless due to brain hemorrhage or clogged blood vessels), half side face drooping. Immediately take a sewing needle and puncture the patient's earlobes at the lowest point, then squeeze out a drop of blood on each side. The sufferer will be immediately cured, and will not have any lasting symptoms.

2. *Heart Stopped Due to Heart Attack*.
Immediately take off the patient socks, and with a sewing needle puncture each one of the person's ten toes, squeezing a drop of blood out. The patient will then wake up. 

3. *When the Patient has Difficulty in Breathing* - regardless whether due to asthma or acute laryngitis, etc., until they start to turn red, quickly puncture the tip of the nose with a needle and squeeze out two drops of black blood. 

The above three methods are not dangerous at all, and can be performed within 10 seconds. Do a good deed and share it with friends! I did! Not only can you share knowledge, but you could also save a life! 👍👍👍
🙏

24/01/18, 11:38 - Geethathe: Good morning Friends, we come across quite few people who are interested in maintaining a desi cow, but are not able to do now or do not have the space. There are also people who are planning to start maintaining a desi cow in 2-3 years time. 

For such people, we offer the traditional model which has been followed for ages in our villages. This model we offer  is only for Hallikar and Amruthmahal breeds. 

We will buy the hallikar cow on behalf of the interested person. The money for the cow is paid by the person (gosevak) . 

We will maintain and take care of the cow at our expense completely. 

The cow will be tagged in the name of the owner, who is the person investing in the cow. 

The person investing in the cow (gosevak) and us, will get one calf each on alternate basis. The value of the calf is usually equal to the value of the cow in 2 years time. Hence the gosevak has got a 100% return on his investment in the cow in 2-3 years time. 

The gosevak can take back the cow anytime after the birth of the second calf or chose to retain with us till they are fine with it. The model continues till the time the  cow is with us. Each of us get a calf alternatively. 

The cost of a good hallikar/amruthmahal breed cow is about rs. 35000. The value of a female  calf is rs. 12000-15000 and male calf is rs. 15000-20000 in one years time. In two years time it's between 25000-30000 for a female and 30000-40000 for a male, as per current market rates. So, the gosevak not only gets to own a cow, his investment is safe and also earns 100% return in 2-3 years time. 

We will take care of the gomatha as our own children giving best feed, medical care and personal attention. 

The cows also can be insured to cover any unexpected loss, although this is a very rare incidence. Hence the investment is safe. 

This will help to preserve our Hallikar /amruthmahal cows which are native to our region. Also will help to Improve the breed so  our focus is on improving breeds native to our region and make them commercially viable as well. 

Since our goshala is at a distance of about 60 kms from Bangalore, gosevaks can visit anytime to see and spend time with the gomatha they own.

People who are interested can contact me on  9910988522. Regards Dr. Pranesh Sridharan

25/01/18, 09:43 - Kampa Aunt: 👩"My Wife, My Wealth" 👸
by the Oshwal Community.
The community, that usually has the surname Shah, has some of the wealthiest people in Kenya.
Many members own top of the range supermarkets, shopping malls, and factories. And the experience of interacting with the top leadership of the community was a major eye opener for me.
When I asked one of the leaders why the community appears to prosper- far more than others:- he gave me a very interesting answer:
"My wife, my wealth" Principle.
He explained to me that they learnt that treating their women well has some very Tangible Benefits. According to them, women are like nature- they multiply what you give them, and give it back to you. They are taught- right early in life to treat their women right, irrespective
"If you give a woman a small seed, after nine months, she will give you a bouncing baby" he started. in in a poetic way he continued...
If you give a woman love, she will adore you,
If you give a woman respect and honour, she will worship you,
If you give a woman time, she will give you a Life Time,
If you give a woman money, she will give you an investment.
On the contrary,
If you you give a woman slaps, life will slap you back. If you oppress your woman, society will oppress you.
He then went ahead to give several examples of societies and communities that mistreat their women. He particularly pointed out at a world famous religion that oppresses its women- and showed me how they are at war with basically every one, and everywhere across the globe.
He then told me to open my eyes, and observe, with complete honesty anyone that treats his wife like trash, and follow how they end up. Or observe anyone that treats his wife like a queen and see how they end up.
He further reiterated, You all men will have to try it, after having lived on your ways for decades, just try this Principle for couple of years, you will be amazed to see your prosperity too.
Believe in "MY WIFE, MY WEALTH" Principle and Prosper.

👌🏻💞just Superb.
             Don't miss reading this💞👌🏻
26/01/18, 07:21 - Kampa Aunt: Women are very selfish. They wear all of man's clothing.
Shirt, Pants, Lungi, Dhoti and everything that a man could wear.
Men don't wear women's garments like Saree, Blouse, Petticoat,  etc.
Recently women snached men's pyjamas and renamed it to Palazo.
Men suffered silently.
The only thing that was left was man's underwear.
Now  that too has been snached away.Watch the video.

27/01/18, 22:20 - Geethathe: If you're not familiar with the work of Steven Wright, he's the famous Erudite (comic) scientist who once said: "I woke up one morning, and all of my stuff had been stolen and replaced by exact duplicates." He sees things differently than most of us.
 
 
 
Here are some of his gems:
1 - I'd kill for a Nobel Peace Prize.

2 - Borrow money from pessimists -- they don't expect it back.

3 - Half the people you know are below average.

4 - 99% of lawyers give the rest a bad name.

6 - A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.

7 - A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.

8 - If you want the rainbow, you have got to put up with the rain.

9 - All those who believe in psycho kinesis, raise my hand.

10 - The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.

11 - I almost had a psychic girlfriend, ...... But she left me before we met.

12 - OK, so what's the speed of dark?

13 - How do you tell when you're out of invisible ink?

14 - If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.

15 - Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.

16 - When everything is coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.

17 - Ambition is a poor excuse for not having enough sense to be lazy.

18 - Hard work pays off in the future; laziness pays off now.

19 - I intend to live forever... So far, so good.

21 - Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.

22 - What happens if you get scared half to death twice?

23 - My mechanic told me, "I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder." 

24 - Why do psychics have to ask you for your name.

25 - If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.

26 - A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.

27 - Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.

28 - The hardness of the butter is proportional to the softness of the bread.

29 - To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is research.

30 - The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard.

31 - The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up. 

32 - The colder the x-ray table, the more of your body is required to be on it.

33 - Everyone has a photographic memory; some just don't have film. 

34 - If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.

And the all-time favourite -

35 - If your car could travel at the speed of light, would your headlights work?

29/01/18, 09:14 - Geethathe: A King had 10 wild dogs. He used them to torture & kill any minister that misguided him.

A Minister once gave an opinion which was wrong which the king didn’t like at all… 
So he ordered that the Minister to be thrown to the dogs.

The Minister said, "I served you loyally for 10 years & you do this..?"

The King was unrelenting.

Minister pleaded, "Please give me 10 days before you throw me to the dogs".

The King agreed. 

In those 10 days, the Minister went to the keeper of the dogs & told him he wanted to serve the dogs for the next 10 days… 

The Guard was baffled… But he agreed.

So the minister started feeding the dogs, caring for them, washing them, providing all sorts of comfort for them.

So when the 10 days were up… 

The King ordered that the minister be thrown to the dogs as sentenced. 

When he was thrown in, everyone was amazed at what they saw...
The dogs were wagging their tails playing with the condemned minister... licking his feet.

The King was baffled at what he saw, "What happened to the dogs?” He growled.

The Minister then said, "I served the dogs for only 10 days & they didn’t forget my service... I served you for 10 years & you forgot all at the first mistake”… 

The King realised his mistake 

and 









Replaced the dogs with crocodiles 🐊!!

04/02/18, 08:47 - Anitha Athe: *Demand for Pension and Equality​ ..* 
Dear All,
We (Both Government and private sector employees) are all working for a cause  contributing to the nation in different sectors​ in different capacity's​ and paying income tax to the government without any discrimination !! 

But when private sector employee retires / injured / demise he/ she and his / her family members doesn't have any support from government..!! But​ government sector employees do have!!!. 🤔 Why this discrimination ?
Major contribution to the society through honest working is from private sector!!

Not that It is not possible..
With a little planning and  channeling of  disbursement of private sector salaries and wages through government treasurey it can be achieved ...... 

Without asking nobody would give it us. (Even mother doesn't give milk to her child if doesn't cry -- saying)

Let us start asking the government demanding equality. It is our right !! 
 let us keep on asking till we get Justice...

13/02/18, 16:04 - Kampa Aunt: A Corporate Story:

      Every day, a small 🐜 Ant arrives  at work very early and starts work immediately.
    
      🐜 She produces  a lot and she was happy.

     The Chief, 🐯 a Tiger, was surprised  to see that 🐜 the Ant was working without supervision.
  
    🐯  He thought if the 🐜 Ant can produce so  much without supervision, wouldn’t she produce even more if she had a supervisor!

      So 🐯 he recruited a 🐝 Bee who had extensive experience as 👷 supervisor and who was  famous for 📝 writing  excellent reports.

     The 🐝 Bee’s first decision was to set up a  🔔 clocking in attendance system.
   
     🐝 He also needed a secretary to help him write and type his reports and he  recruited a 🐇Rabbit , who managed the archives and monitored ☎ all phone calls.

      🐯 The Tiger was delighted with the 🐝 Bee's reports and asked him to produce 📊 graphs  to describe production rates and to analyse  📉 trends, so that he could use them for 📁 presentations at Board‘s meetings.

     So the 🐝 Bee had to buy a 💻 new computer and a  Laser printer and recruited a 🐈 Cat to manage the 🌐 IT department.

      The🐜 Ant, who had once been so productive and relaxed, hated this new plethora of paperwork  and meetings which used up most of her time…!

   🐯  The Tiger came to the conclusion that it was high time to nominate a person in charge of the department where the 🐜 Ant worked. 

     The position was given to the 🐒 Monkey, whose first decision was to buy an Air Conditioner and an ergonomic 💺 chair for his office.
   
     The new person in charge, 🐒 the Monkey, also needed a 💻 computer and a personal assistant , who he brought from his previous department, to help him prepare a 📑 Work and 📃 'Budget Control Strategic Optimisation Plan' …

     The Department where the 🐜 Ant works is now a sad place, where nobody laughs anymore  and everybody has become upset...

     It was at that time that the 🐝 Bee convinced the boss, 🐯  the Tiger; of the absolute necessity  to start a climatic study of the environment . 

      Having reviewed  the  charges  for running the 🐜 Ant’s department , the 🐯 Tiger  found out that  the Production   was much less than  before.

     So he recruited the 🐤 Owl, a prestigious and renowned consultant to carry out an  audit and  suggest solutions.

     🐤 The Owl spent three months  in the department and came up with an enormous report, in several volumes, that concluded...
                   .
                   .
                   .
                   .
       “ The Department is overstaffed ...”
                   .
                   .
                   .
                   .

   Guess who the 🐯 Tiger fires first?
                   .
                   .
                   .
                   .
                   .

          Of course, 🐜 the Ant.........,


 

         "....because she showed lack of motivation and had a negative attitude. "

                  ***********
         "The Characters in this fable are fictitious; any resemblance to real people or  facts within the Corporation is pure coincidence only…"
This is really worth reading.
13/02/18, 16:14 - Kampa Aunt: One of the most disturbing stories that we find in the Puranas is the story of Krishna's son Samba, whose mother was the bear-princess, Jambavati.

He dupes his father's junior wives by disguising himself as Krishna and is cursed by Krishna that he will suffer from a skin disease that will enable his wives to distinguish father and son. Samba is cured after he builds temples to the sun. All sun temples in India, from Konark in Odisha to Modhera in Gujarat to Markand in Kashmir, are attributed to this son of Krishna.
 
Samba also attempts to kidnap Duryodhana's daughter and this leads to war between the Kauravas and the Yadavas. Peace is restored, and the marriage is solemnised, only after Balarama, Krishna's elder brother, and Samba's uncle, in a fit of fury threatens to drag Hastinapur into the sea. 

Then there is the story of Samba pretending to be a pregnant woman and duping sages who were visiting Dwaraka. They sages were not amused and cursed Samba that he would give birth to an iron mace that would be responsible for the end of the Yadu clan. 

Must not Krishna's son be as noble and divine and wise and loving as Krishna? But that is not so. Samba comes with his own personality and his own destiny over which Krishna has no influence. Or does he? 

Can we wonder if Samba was a product of his father's neglect? For was not Krishna spending most of his time with Arjuna and the Pandavas and in the politics of Kuru-kshetra?
 
There are hardly any stories of Krishna as father. He is friend, philosopher and guide to Arjuna, but the only stories of father and son are of tension, rage and violence. 

In conversations about corporates, we often forget about the other half of our lives, the personal one. As more and more people are working 24x7, thanks to Internet, and smart devices, the lines between professional and personal, work and life are getting blurred. In fact, people feel noble when they sacrifice family for work and guilty when they take a holiday to take care of their family. 

Family is not seen as achievement. Children are not seen as purpose. They are seen as obligations, duties, by-products of existence, even collateral damage.  

We admire leaders who sacrifice family for a 'larger' cause. Like freedom fighters who neglect their wives and children. Like business men and entrepreneurs and consultants who spend most of their time in office.

With the rise of feminism, women are also working. Parenting has been outsourced to maids, teachers, computers, videogames and grandparents.

Women who work in the office have not been compensated by their husbands spending more time at home. Instead women are made to feel guilty for not being good mothers. No one questions men for not being good fathers. Eventually, the office wins. Absent parents rationalise how office is more important than the children: we need the money, the children eventually grow up, surely our needs are also important. 

Many great Krishnas in the workplace discover that they have nurtured Samba at home: sons who either follow destructive paths as they seek attention, or sons who make their way away from parents, as they have grown used to not having them around. Who wins?

Corporates were supposed to create wealth for the family. Now families are creating only workers for the corporates. 

We have many more Krishnas in this generation and maybe many Sambas in the next.

If your husband hasn't done anything for Valentine's Day and has pissed you off..
Boil water
Let it boil, boil, boil, and boil.
As the water is still boiling.. wait for him to fall asleep.
When you are very sure that he is sleeping.. 
make some tea and drink it.
Tea reduces stress.
For those who expected hot water to be poured on him, you need serious help!
15/02/18, 17:37 - Sugama: So cute😘
15/02/18, 19:00 - Kampa Aunt: 10 English words used only by Indians
 
1. Mother Promise

For ages, you have always used this word without even knowing if it was a legit word, haven't you? So we decided to burst your bubble! While the word 'promise' features in the Oxford Dictionary, there's no mention of 'mother promise'. Surprised? Wondering how 'mother promise' came into being. It's the literal English translation of 'ma kasam' or 'aai shapath'. The next time you want to stand by something you really mean, try using just 'promise'. You don't really need to drag your mother into everything, do you?

2. Cousin sister and cousin brother

According to the Oxford Dictionary a 'cousin' is a child of one's uncle or aunt. And Grammar Nazis would insist that the word 'cousin' does not need to be followed with words like 'sister' or 'brother'. Did you know that 'cousin sister or cousin brother' are words used only in India. The right way is just to say 'cousin'. Wondering how you'd get to know their gender. Well, that's what names are for, aren't they?

3. Good name

When Indians meet strangers, why do they ask the question, 'What's you GOOD NAME?' Every parent or grandparent who has named the child, does it with a GOOD intention. So there's nothing bad about a name. The next time you meet a stranger, you could say 'What's your name?'

4. Revert back

Now this one's tricky! Because that's what you have been writing in e-mails, haven't you? Well according to The Free Dictionary 'revert' means 'to reply to someone'. Why use 'revert back' when you can just say 'revert'?

5.  Rubber

In India the 'eraser' is also called 'rubber'! But in the rest of the world, 'rubber' is a slang for 'condom'. Now it makes sense why your relatives and friends in foreign countries complain that people there burst out laughing when they ask for a 'rubber' instead of an 'eraser'.

6. Picture

When was the last time you mentioned that you were going to 'watch a 'picture'?' No one really knows when 'picture' became synonymous with 'films' or 'movies' in India. According to the Oxford Dictionary, 'picture' means a drawing or painting. You could say 'I am going out to watch a movie or film'.

7. Mention not

Isn't it funny that every time someone thanks an Indian, they quickly turn around and say 'mention not'. We are still scratching our heads wondering how the word originated and what it means. There are plenty of ways you can accept someone's thanks.You can use any of the following:

You're welcome.
It's my pleasure.
That's alright.
No problem.

8. Pass out

How is it that every Indian graduating from college is passing out? Confused? Let's tell you the difference. When you are really drunk and become unconscious, you 'pass out'. But when you refer to a successful completion of a course or training, you use the word 'graduate'.

9. Cheatercock

We all have used this word in our childhood. Once, twice, thrice…we have lost count of the number of times we called someone a 'cheatercock'! But ever wondered what does the word mean? We are still wondering! According to the Oxford Dictionary, cheater is a person who acts dishonestly in order to gain advantage. Won't it be sufficient if we just said 'cheater'?

10. Would be

How would you introduce your fiance?

Amit: Hello uncle.

Uncle: Hello Amit.

Amit: Uncle, I would like to introduce you to my 'would be'.

Unfortunately Amit doesn't know that 'would be' means nothing. If you want to introduce your to-be bride then simply use 'fiance'. How easy is that!

08/03/18, 11:11 - Puneeth: Every day I see Sinchu, and all the wonderful mothers and sisters around me, I realize that they were not born but rather became women, when they became selfless, when they were the first to say I'll take care of it or I'll do it, when nothing could tire them out, when they made us believe we could do anything and when nothing could ever stop them from doing a zillion things at the same time. No matter how hard we try we can never be you. Thanks to all you wonderful women for completing us. 
Happy Women's Day 💐
08/03/18, 11:22 - Dimpakka: That's really nice of you Puneeth😊 thank you!

08/03/18, 16:58 - Mummy: ಒಬ್ಬ ಗರ್ಭಿಣಿ ಹೆಣ್ಣು ತನ್ನ ಗಂಡನಿಗೆ ಕೇಳ್ತಾಳೆ, "ನಿಮಗೆ ಗಂಡು ಮಗು ಬೇಕಾ ಅಥವ ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಗುನಾ?"

ಗಂಡ;- ನಮಗೆ ಏನಾದರೂ ಗಂಡು ಮಗುವಾದರೆ, ನಾನು ಅವನಿಗೆ ಗಣಿತ ಕಲಿಸ್ತೇನೆ, ನಾವಿಬ್ಬರೂ ಆಟ ಆಡೋಕೆ ಹೋಗುತ್ತೇವೆ, ಅವನಿಗೆ ಮೀನು ಹಿಡಿಯೋದನ್ನು ಕಲಿಸ್ತೇನೆ,"

ಹೆಂಡತಿ;- "ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಗು ಆದರೆ?"

ಗಂಡ;- ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಗುವಾದರೆ ನಾನವಳಿಗೆ ಏನೂ ಕಲಿಸೋ ಅವಶ್ಯಕತೆನೇ ಇರಲ್ಲ"

"ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಆಕೇನೆ ನನಗೆ ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಕಲಿಸುತ್ತಾಳೆ, ಏನು ತೊಡಬೇಕು, ಏನು ತಿನ್ನಬೇಕು, ಏನು ಹೇಳಬೇಕು ಅಥವ ಏನು ಹೇಳಬಾರದು ಅಂತ."

"ಒಂದು ರೀತಿ ಆಕೆ ನನ್ನ ಎರಡನೆಯ ತಾಯಿಯಾಗಿರ್ತಾಳೆ, ನಾನು ಅವಳಿಗಾಗಿ ಏನೂ ಮಾಡದಿದ್ದರೂ, ನನ್ನನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ಹೀರೊ ಅಂದುಕೊಳ್ತಾಳೆ."

"ಏನನ್ನಾದರೂ ನಿರಾಕರಿಸಿದರೆ ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿ ಹೇಳ್ತಾಳೆ, ತನ್ನ ಗಂಡನಲ್ಲಿ ನನ್ನನ್ನು ನೋಡಲು ಬಯಸುತ್ತಾಳೆ."

ತಾನು ಎಷ್ಟೇ ದೊಡ್ಡವಳಾದರೂ, ತಂದೆ baby doll ಥರ ತನ್ನನ್ನು ಪ್ರೀತಿಸಲಿ ಎಂದು ಬಯಸುತ್ತಾಳೆ."

"ಅವಳು ನನಗಾಗಿ ಜಗತ್ತನ್ನೇ ಎದುರಿಸ್ತಾಳೆ, ನನಗೆ ಕಷ್ಟ ಕೊಟ್ಟವರನ್ನು ಅವಳು ಎಂದಿಗೂ ಕ್ಷಮಿಸಲ್ಲ."

ಹೆಂಡತಿ;- ನಿಮ್ಮ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮಗಳು ಮಾಡಿದ್ದನ್ನು, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮಗ ಮಾಡಲಾರನೆ?"

ಗಂಡ;- ಹಾಗೇನಿಲ್ಲ ಮಗನೂ ಮಾಡಬಹುದು, ಆದರೆ ಅವನಿಗೆ ಇದೆಲ್ಲಾ ಕಲಿಯಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತೆ."

"ಆದರೆ ಮಗಳು, ಈ ಎಲ್ಲ ಗುಣಗಳ ಜೊತೆಗೆ ಹುಟ್ಟಿರ್ತಾಳೆ. ಮಗಳಿಗೆ ತಂದೆಯಾಗುವುದು ಪ್ರತಿ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಗೂ ಹೆಮ್ಮೆಯ ವಿಷಯ."

ಹೆಂಡತಿ;- "ಆದರೆ ಮಗಳು ನಮ್ಮ ಜೊತೆ ಯಾವಾಗಲೂ ಇರಲ್ಲ ಅಲ್ವಾ?"

ಗಂಡ;- "ಹೌದು, ಆದರೆ ನಾವು ಯಾವಾಗಲೂ ಅವಳ ಹ್ರದಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರ್ತೇವೆ."

"ಅವಳು ಎಲ್ಲೇ ಇದ್ದರೂ ಅಪ್ಸರೆಯಾಗಿರ್ತಾಳೆ."

"ಮಗಳು ಹುಟ್ಟೋದೆ ನಿಸ್ವಾರ್ಥ ಪ್ರೀತಿ ಹಾಗೂ ಕಾಳಜಿ ಮಾಡೋಕೆ."

"ಮಗಳು" ಎಲ್ಲರ ಹಣೆಬರಹದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರಲ್ಲ, ದೇವರಿಗೆ ಇಷ್ಟವಾದ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮಗಳು ಹುಟ್ಟೋದು."

This poem is especially for those who have sons👶

Sons are the spark in the dark💥💥💥

From a wee lad to a man strong and tall👨
He is a real hero and we are his all💪

Sons are true definition of SUN in everyway🌞🌞
And so be proud for him everyday👏👏👏
                                 
BE PROUD TO BE A PARENT OF A SON

12/03/18, 21:45 - Kampa Aunt: My house is  'My HOME' not a hotel Room

Dirty dishes prove I feed my family.  A full trash can mean I clean up after them.

Messy floors mean I let my child have fun.

A pile of unfolded laundry means I keep my family in clean cloths.

A wet bathroom means my kid took  a shower.

So when you walk into my house and see a 'mess' think twice before you judge.

If you come over to see us,  come on in....
If you are coming over to see my house please make an appointment.

just to make you point that 

I am a human being not a robot to run behind every act of the family members and reset all mess immediately.

- I am a WIfe 
- I am a mother 
- I am a friend
- I am a daughter and  a sister
There are no. of other activities other than housekeeping.

Last but not the least " I HAVE MY OWN MOOD"

Source :  Attitude

I am still in search of a suitable good word which suits me..Not as house wife, home maker,whatever...

DEDICATED TO ALL WOMEN 🙏

13/03/18, 12:17 - Mummy: "Acting ಮಾಡುವುದರಲ್ಲಿ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರು ಸೂಪರ್ 

"ಹೌದು, 

ಮಾಡಿದ ಅಡುಗೆ ಕಡಿಮೆ ಇದ್ದರೆ ಹಸಿವಿಲ್ಲದಂತೆ ನಟಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ

ನೋವಿದ್ದರೂ ಮಕ್ಕಳೆದುರು ನಗುತ್ತಾರೆ

ಸುಸ್ತಾದರೂ ಅತಿಥಿಗಳೆದುರು ಹುರುಪಿನಿಂದ ಇರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ಹಣ ಇಲ್ಲದೇ ಒದ್ದಾಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದರೂ ತವರು ಮನೆಯವರೆದುರು ಶ್ರೀಮಂತರಂತೆ ನಟಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ

ಕಣ್ಣೀರನ್ನು  ಕಣ್ಣಿಗೆ ಕಸ ಬಿದ್ದದ್ದು ಹೇಳ್ತಾರೆ

ಗಂಡ ಪೀಡಿಸಿದರೂ
ಗೆಳತಿಯರೊಂದಿಗೆ ಗಂಡನಿಗೆ
ನಾನೆಂದ್ರೆ ಪ್ರಾಣ ಹೇಳ್ತಾರೆ.

ಸಾರಿ ಬೇಕಿದ್ದರೂ ತುಂಬಾ 
ಸಾರಿ ಇದೆಯಲ್ವಾ ಹೇಳ್ತಾರೆ

ತಿಂಗಳ
ಸಹಿಸಲಸಾದ್ಯ ನೋವನ್ನು
ನಗುತ್ತಾ ಆಡಗಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ..

ಪೇಟೆಗೆ ಹೋಗುವಾಗ
ಹಣವಿಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೂ
ಸಾಕು ಎಡ್ಜೆಸ್ಟ್ ಮಾಡ್ತೇನೆ ಹೇಳ್ತಾರೆ

ಬೆಲೆ ಬಾಳುವ ಡ್ರೆಸ್ಸ್ ನೋಡಿ
ಕೊನೆಗೆ ಕಮ್ಮಿ ಕ್ರಯದ ಡ್ರೆಸ್ಸ್ ಚಂದ ಎಂದು ಸುಳ್ಳು ಹೇಳ್ತಾರೆ..

ಇನ್ನೂ ಇದೆ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರ ನಟನೆ. 
ಆದರೆ ಅವಾರ್ಡ್ ಕೊಡುವವರು ಮಾತ್ರ ಯಾರೂ ಇಲ್ಲ ಅಷ್ಟೇ"

04/04/18, 13:57 - Dimpakka: Fun time:  a poem by Mahati Patel

In the green grass
Play a lad and a lass

On the bare ground
They go round and round

They play on a seesaw
And hear a donkey braying heehaw

They play on the swing
And on the bicycle go tring tring

They enjoy the slide 
And in the swimming pool they glide

On the monkey bars
They play for hours and hours

They play not one game
And they are all not the same
04/04/18, 13:57 - Dimpakka: Christmas poem: By Mahati Patel

 

Its Christmas time

Jingle Bells chime

 

It’s time to celebrate

Until its very late

 

In the frosty air

Lets hop like a hare

 

And eat a mince pie

They set down to lie

 

In the dark night

When there is no light

 

Santa Claus lifts

Very special gifts

 

And place them under the Christmas tree

Lets count the gifts  - one, two, three

11/04/18, 10:01 - Kampa Aunt: PLS SHARE IN ALL DOCTOR GROUPS 

Finally something for the doctors...

Dr Ramesh Ganesan asked a medico legal question
21 hours ago - 

DO NOT  IGNORE. 

"DOCTORS VS JUDGES":

 Judiciary should also come under CPA (Consumer Protection Act).

"Every body must READ and SHARE this article.      

--In the Salman Khan hit and run case the LOWER court judge and the HIGH court judge had the SAME pieces of EVIDENCE to deal with.

--They also had the SAME Indian LAW to abide by and most probably they had similar education qualifications too. 

--Yet they INTERPRETED the situation in absolutely CONTRASTING manner and gave verdicts which are poles apart. 

--Just imagine what would have happened if a YOUNG doctor sitting in a GOVERNMENT hospital doctor catering to hundreds of patients in a day had diagnosed a celebrity patient presenting with gastric discomfort as GASTRITIS and another hospital had LATER on diagnosed that patient to be having a MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. I am sure that doctor would have been screwed and jailed. 

--A JUDGE gets YEARS to decide on a case 
unlike a DOCTOR who is expected to diagnose and treat everything in the BLINK of an eye.

--If a doctor making a wrong diagnosis can be prosecuted shouldn't a judge giving wrong verdicts meet the same fate? 

--If hospitals can be sued for not admitting poor patients shouldn't the courts be prosecuted for having lacs of impending cases?

--Is it not appalling that a judge taking 12 years to give a wrong verdict gets away unhurt and a doctor making one mistake is screwed by our legal system?

--Doctors practice medicine which is more of an art than an exact science whereas law is absolutely 100% manmade, yet doctors are expected to be right on all occasions.

--If doctors and hospitals have a duty towards the society then does the judiciary not have a responsibility towards the socitey.

--If there is so much of hue and cry in media about doctors and hospitals charging huge sums from patients then why do we not ever hear a word on the fee that lawyers like Manu singhvi and Jethmalani charge for their court appearances.

--Government often talks about putting a capping on the fees doctors charge for various procedures but their is no talk of putting a capping on the fee that these lawyers charge to get justice for their clients. 

--If health is a citizen's right then so is justice. Shall we take our minds off worshipping false heroes & think? 

*JUDICIARY SHOULD ALSO COME UNDER CPA (CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT)*

Please share if you agree.

15/04/18, 08:04 - Manumama: ”sharing is caring”.

 Dear all 
     It takes immense pleasure to announce that we have established a new foundation in the name of “BELAKU “ ( Belaku institute of training healthcare and research) on April 11th 2018. 
     With increasing demand for advanced technology and with its associated cost, the treatment for common is far fetched . It’s our primary objective to make the advanced treatment be it laser , Laparoscopic or Robotic are made available to the poor/ farmers/ elderly citizens etc 

    Also there is dearth in getting trained  in advanced technology as there are few centres and acute short of talent to cater the need. Hence we took up that part as one of our major objective to train young urologists / students and encouraging and persuading them to do research there by helping the society at large 
This Trust shall be a public charitable trust having no commercial or profit motive. It shall be maintained and administered to promote medical and dental relief for the weaker section of public, provide medical treatment and rehabilitation services, education, advanced treatment, research activities  and training and any other objects of general public utility. The benefit of this Trust shall ensure to all section of public in India without any discrimination and distinction.

    If all of us join together and be part this venture , we surely will be able to reach the needy. Further our trust has been granted with provision of sec 80G which in turn benefit  either parties . 
       As a first initiative we  have started a teaching programme for young urologists and the grants collected will be used for free surgery/ treatment of the patients undergoing procedure during workshop. In that all the three , the trainee, the trainer and the patient’s benefited. 

   Please identify the needy and share with us and we are there to reach out to them 
 If you really want to help your  near needy ones I request your generosity and help us with the grant 
send in your contributions to .....

DO NOT SHAMPOO IN THE SHOWER.
I don't know why I didn't figure this out sooner. I used shampoo in the shower and when we wash our hair the shampoo runs down our whole body. Printed clearly on the shampoo label is the warning, "for extra body and volume." No wonder I have been gaining weight.
I should get rid of shampoos and start using dish washing liquid. Its label reads "dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove." Follow this and stay slim and trim forever. ;) ;)

11/05/18, 08:51 - Puneeth: 👌🏻👍🏻
12/05/18, 10:56 - Baava: Here's my analysis based on opinion poll(my own opinion) and exit poll of  7 voters
12/05/18, 10:56 - Baava: Vote shares:

INC: 38-40%
BJP: 32-33%

12/05/18, 11:22 - Manumama: 😄😄
12/05/18, 11:23 - Geethathe: <Media omitted>
12/05/18, 11:26 - Baava: The only way JDS can win: HDD needed to have fathered more sons😊
12/05/18, 11:28 - Manumama: But still if Gowda’s wants to live it’s going to be with JDS support only . Siddu has already crushed Gowda’s
12/05/18, 11:29 - Baava: It is not true..except old Mys belt vokkaligas support INC
12/05/18, 11:29 - Manumama: In india every one is corrupt and we elect corrupt people ... so let’s help atleast our community
12/05/18, 11:30 - Baava: JDS is. 3 district father&son party
12/05/18, 11:30 - Baava: Jai Siddu😊
12/05/18, 11:30 - Manumama: INC is also a father and grand father dynasty
12/05/18, 11:30 - Baava: Yes
12/05/18, 11:30 - Baava: Great grandfather
12/05/18, 11:30 - Manumama: Now Daughert in law and joker rahul in the show
12/05/18, 11:31 - Baava: Anyway each one to himself or herself
12/05/18, 11:31 - Manumama: So india is also ruled by them for 50 years
12/05/18, 11:31 - Baava: I just conveyed my own opinion
12/05/18, 11:31 - Baava: Let's wait for the 15th
12/05/18, 11:31 - Manumama: What’s wrong i HDD and sons ruling
12/05/18, 11:32 - Manumama: BJP will get 130 for sure
12/05/18, 11:50 - Baava: Trying to convince thatha not to vote JDS..appears  father-son share same political leanings too😊
12/05/18, 13:14 - Kampa Aunt: <Media omitted>
12/05/18, 17:15 - Baava: One prediction which will definitely happen..petrol price increase will be announced soon..so better to get ur tanks filled up..no increase in last 15 days
12/05/18, 18:40 - Baava: So India Today axis exit poll
12/05/18, 18:40 - Baava: INC: 106-118
BJP: 79-82

12/05/18, 18:51 - Baava: Anyway this is all academic now
12/05/18, 18:51 - Baava: 15th may it is
12/05/18, 18:54 - Baava: Times Now:
INC: 90-103
BJP: 80-93
JDS: 31-39
12/05/18, 20:13 - Manumama: <Media omitted>
12/05/18, 20:13 - Manumama: Seems to be reality
12/05/18, 20:24 - Baava: 15th may it is
12/05/18, 20:25 - Baava: Except UP elex, in last 3 yrs , both opinion and exit polls have given BJP 15-20% extra seats
12/05/18, 20:25 - Baava: Mainly because they oversample urban voters and don't properly normalize it in their models
12/05/18, 20:34 - Baava: This is by today's chanayka
12/05/18, 20:34 - Baava: They gave 135+- 11 for BJP and 47+-11 for INC IN Dec
12/05/18, 20:35 - Baava: We all know how it turned out..

13/05/18, 10:36 - Manumama: Sucide for doctors and pilots
13/05/18, 11:09 - Baava: What he says is absolutely correct
13/05/18, 11:10 - Baava: AI is changing the world and this will happen sooner than we realize
13/05/18, 11:18 - Baava: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-organizations-and-work/what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages
13/05/18, 11:22 - Manumama: What is important is that these are developed by humans and not machines. With out humans navigation of any thing in life is next to impossible .
13/05/18, 11:22 - Manumama: It’s hilarious on his part as usual
13/05/18, 11:22 - Manumama: He isn’t qualified
13/05/18, 11:24 - Baava: He isn't qualified..agree
13/05/18, 11:25 - Baava: But AI being my research area for last 4 years, most of us are under estimating what it can do and what it will eventually do..
13/05/18, 11:26 - Baava: We can only ignore it at our own peril
13/05/18, 13:21 - Madhumama: <Media omitted>

14/05/18, 19:22 - Geethathe: Breaking news :Rahul Gandhi demands recounting of Exit polls
14/05/18, 20:54 - Kampa Aunt: "Mom, I am a genetic scientist. I am working in the US on  the evolution of man. Theory of evolution. Charles Darwin, have you heard of him? " Vasu asked.


          His Mother sat next to him,  smiled and said, "I know about Darwin, Vasu. But Have you heard of Dashavatar? The ten avatars of Vishnu?" 


Vasu replied yes. 


          "Ok! Then let me tell you what you and your Darwin don't know.


        Listen carefully- 


        The first avatar was the Matsya avatar, it means the fish. That is because life began in the water. Is that not right?" 


          Vasu began to listen with a little more attention.


            She continued, "Then came the Kurma Avatar, which means the tortoise, because life moved from the water to the land. The amphibian! So the Tortoise denoted the evolution from sea to land.


            Third avatar was Varaha, the wild boar, which meant the wild animals with not much intellect, you call them the Dinosaurs, correct?" Vasu nodded wide eyed.


            "The fourth avatar was Narasimha, half man and half animal, the evolution from wild animals to intelligent beings.


            Fifth, the Vaman avatar, the midget or dwarf, who could grow really tall. Do you know why that is? Because, there were two kinds of humans, Homo Erectus and Homo Sapiens and Homo Sapiens won that battle." 


            Vasu could see that his Mother was in full flow and he was stupefied.


          "The Sixth avatar was Parshuram, the man who wielded the axe, the man who was a cave and forest dweller. Angry, and not social.


          The seventh avatar was Ram, the first rational thinking social being, who practised and laid out the laws of society and the basis of human relationships.


          The Eighth avatar was Balarama, a true farmer who showed  value of agriculture in the life.


          The Ninth avatar was Krishna, the statesman, the politician, the diplomat, the Ambassador, the sutile interpreter, the lover who played the game of society and taught how to live and thrive in the adhaarmic social structure.


          And finally, my boy, will come Kalki, the man you are working on. The man who will be genetically supreme."


            Vasu looked at his Mother speechless. "This is amazing Mom, how did you .... ? This makes sense!"


          She said, "Yes it does, son! We Indians knew some amazing things, but just didn't know how to pass it on scientifically. So we made them into mythological stories.  Mythology creates faith and makes man sensible. It is just the way you look at it - Religious or Scientific. Your call."


( A Must Read n pass it on to other people to appreciate Indian knowledge which was way ahead than today's modern science)
15/05/18, 17:40 - Arpith: Time and again it's proven that the guy who score 35% is happier than who score distinction..😂😂😂

15/05/18, 18:52 - Baava: So my prediction was:
Vote shares:

INC: 38-40%
BJP: 32-33%
JDS: 18-20%

Not too bad if u ignore my seat prediction..I can have an alternative career in exit polling once I retire!

10/06/18, 11:31 - Baava: <Media omitted>
10/06/18, 11:32 - Baava: Some analysis.. power of compounding over 10 years
10/06/18, 11:34 - Baava: Over long term our most preferred investments like gold , FD are very poor
10/06/18, 12:15 - Puneeth: 👍🏻
10/06/18, 12:16 - Puneeth: Is SBI small cap still a good option to go with for the next 5-10 yrs?
10/06/18, 12:17 - Baava: No idea..but any small cap fund will beat all other instruments over a 10 yr period
10/06/18, 12:18 - Baava: Both small cap and mid caps have done very badly this year
10/06/18, 12:18 - Puneeth: Yeah. The story for small cap was pretty good in the last 10 yrs. So I was wondering will that still look good for the next 10 yrs?
10/06/18, 12:19 - Baava: Oh yes
10/06/18, 12:19 - Puneeth: 👍🏻
10/06/18, 12:19 - Baava: Small cap stocks will become mid cap and mid cap will become large stocks
10/06/18, 12:19 - Baava: So the funds will buy small cap stocks
10/06/18, 12:19 - Puneeth: Yeah
10/06/18, 12:21 - Baava: Even if I go wrong I can't be beaten up by any of you for 10 years😊
10/06/18, 12:22 - Puneeth: Ha ha ha 😃 that's how advisors in this business have survived and thrived for decades 😉
10/06/18, 12:23 - Baava: Well..advisors rarely give long term plans
10/06/18, 12:47 - Baava: None of these take tax savings into account
10/06/18, 12:49 - Baava: But close ended funds (which give tax benefit) shd be avoided for long term capital appreciation
10/06/18, 12:49 - Puneeth: 👍🏻
10/06/18, 12:50 - Baava: Best is to keep 6-8 months requirement in savings acct and start SIP
10/06/18, 12:52 - Baava: For young long term investors: avoid gold and FD
10/06/18, 12:53 - Baava: I mean gold as investment instrument..
10/06/18, 12:54 - Baava: Buy good term insurance and health insurance
10/06/18, 12:56 - Baava: Buy health insurance from outside even if the company provided insurance is good..the   total corpus will keep increasing due to no claim..also it will give a good cushion if we plan to stop working in the future
10/06/18, 13:01 - Puneeth: Yes. Done all the above 👍🏻
10/06/18, 13:02 - Baava: Great..I officially declare u young😊

24/06/18, 11:28 - Kampa Aunt: SAFE - DRIVING TIPS ............ 

WHEN IT IS RAINING !!!

GOOD VISION IN A DOWNPOUR.
How to achieve good vision while driving during a heavy downpour. We are not sure why it is so effective; Just try this method when it rains heavily. This method was told by a Police friend who had experienced and confirmed it.

It is useful...even driving at night.

Most of the motorists would turn wind sheild wipers on 'HIGH' or on the  'FASTEST SPEED' during heavy downpour, yet the visibility in front of the windshield is still bad..
In the event you face such a situation, just put on your 'SUNGLASSES'  and miracles!

All of a sudden, your visibility in front of your windshield is perfectly clear, as if there is no rain.

Make sure you always have a pair of SUNGLASSES in your car. You are not only helping yourself to drive safely with good vision, but also might save your friend's life by giving him this idea.Try it yourself and share it with your friends...!!!Amazingly, you'll still see the drops on the windshield, but not the sheet of rain falling.You'll also see where the rain bounces off the road. Wearing sunglasses works to eliminate the "blindness" from passing cars. Or the "kickup" if you are following a car in the rain. They ought to teach this little tip in driver's training. It really does work. This is a good warning.

I wonder how many people knew about this??? 

Another good tip:
A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago. It was raining,though not excessively when her car suddenly began to hydro-plane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence!

When she explained to the PoliceOfficer what had happened, he told her something that every driver should know - 
NEVER - EVER 'DRIVE' IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON.'
She however, thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the Police Officer told her that if the cruise control is on, your car will in fact begin to hydro-plane. When the tires lose contact with the road,your car will automatically accelerate to a higher rate of speed, making you take off like an aeroplane.

She told the Officer that was exactly what had occurred.

The Officer said; 'This warning should be listed, on the driver's seat sun-visor -

'NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE ROAD IS WET OR ICY'

Along with the airbag warning. 'We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed - but; 'We don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the road is dry.

The only person the accident victim found who knew this, (besides the Officer), was a man who'd had a similar accident, totalled his car and sustained severe injuries.

NOTE:

Some vehicles (like the Toyota Sienna Limited XLE) will not allow you to set the cruise control when your windshield wipers are on.

Even if you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about it, it's still worth it.'You may have saved a life.'

16/07/18, 19:47 - Manumama: Oh .
I used to remember him very often for the following reason 
I always used to get 100/100 in maths or nearly to that and fails miserably in all othe subjects , worst is the social studies. 
No teacher ( especially Shobha dove and Muthamna) used to like me as I was not good in other subjects . 
However when ever narhona comes for school inspection ... he used to comes into class room and always ask “ who got highest in mathematics “ ? . Please raise your hand !!!
Obviously I used to raise my hand with pride( that was the only occasion I raised my hand in st joseph) , and He used to give  100 rupees to the person who has highest . Like that I pocketed 300 rupees. 
Every time he asked only mathematics marks , which was to my advantage and Everyone else used to feel “J” including teachers 

I really do miss him 
May his soul rest in peace
16/07/18, 19:54 - Dimpakka: Oh nice... Never knew this story about your schooling😊

Hats off to her. Please listen to the hit song "Shankaraa..Naada" from film Shankarabharanam.

25/07/18, 21:28 - Kampa Aunt: Meenakshi Ahuja:
1) Toothpaste: Buff a CD/DVD
Apply toothpaste to a cotton ball and wipe the disc. Wash with water afterwards and you’ve got a brand new disc!
2) Cornstarch: Untangle Knots
Sprinkling cornstarch into tough knots, such as shoe laces helps loosen them.
3) Walnut: Buff Dings out of Wood Furniture
Get rid of unsightly scratches and dings on wood furniture by rubbing a walnut on the areas. The blemishes will vanish quickly and your furniture and pocket book will be saved.
4) Club Soda: Make Your Breads Fluffier
When baking, where recipes call for water, add club soda instead to make pancakes, waffles and any other breads fluffier.
5) Salt: Keep Windows Frost Free
Pour a cup of salt into a liter of water. Sponge the liquid onto the inside of window to prevent frost from forming during the winter months.
6) Rubbing Alcohol: Remove Permanent Marker
Dab the surface that has the permanent marker on it with a cloth or cotton ball covered in rubbing alcohol to make it disappear quickly.
7) Chap stick: Stops Bleeding When Nicked Shaving
Cut yourself shaving? Just swipe some chap stick over the cut to stop that constant bleeding. No more tissue squares! Apple Juice: Removes Dandruff
Don’t ask how it works, but it does! Instead of buying a special shampoo, just wash your hair in apple juice to rid your scalp of pesky dandruff.
9) Aspirin: Get Rid of Armpit Stains on T-Shirts
Grind up an aspirin tablet or two, then make a paste out of it using water, lemon or vinegar. Spread the paste on the stained area and let sit for an hour before washing.
10) Olive Oil: Make Pets’ Coat Shinier
Add a bit of olive oil to your pet’s food to give them a healthier, shinier coat of fur.
11) Newspapers: Clean Windows and Mirrors
Instead of using a spray and a streaky cloth, use only newspaper to clean off your mirrors and windows for a streak-free finish.
12) Baking Soda: Remove Bugs from Windshield
Mix baking soda with warm water to make a paste. Spread the paste over your windshield for fifteen minutes. Then wipe or spray off with a hose.
13) Bleach: Extend Life of Flowers in Vase
Add a few drops of bleach to vase water to prevent the build-up of the slime caused by bacteria. It works just like chlorine in a swimming pool.
14) Kitchen Dish Soap: Flea-Killing Dog Shampoo
Kitchen dish soap (not dish detergent) can double as dog shampoo for its flea killing abilities.
15) Coke: Remove Blood Stains from Clothing
Soak the stain in coke until the stain is dissolved, then wash the clothing as usual. Wash before the coke dries, though.
16) Honey: Remove Blemish Overnight
Have a blemish you need to get rid of by tomorrow? Put a dab of honey on the blemish and cover it up (it’s best to use a Band-Aid) and the honey’s natural antibacterial properties will clean out the bacteria by the morning.
17) Wax Paper: Clean Can Opener Gears
Run a few small strips of wax paper through the can opener to clean out of the bits and pieces that have built up in the gears throughout the year. The wax will also rub off on the gears to protect for future use as well.
18) WD-40: Remove Crayons from Walls
Use the lubricant and a cloth to remove stubborn crayon marks from the walls just by spraying the wall and wiping with a cloth.
19) Chalk: Keep Ants and Slugs Out of the House
Ants and Slugs Won’t Touch Chalk. So, simply draw a line in front of your doorway where you are having problems with these pesky critters and they won’t cross it, meaning they won’t be able to get into your house.
20) Vinegar: Kills Weeds and Helps Flowers Grow
Vinegar is a magic wonder when it comes to gardening. It not only kills weeds but they help flowers grow as well. Douse vinegar all around your garden to prevent weeds from popping up and to help your flowers to grow healthy and strong.
21) Mayonnaise: Remove Bumper Sticker
Spread mayonnaise on the bumper sticker and let sit for at least thirty minutes. Then, rub the sticker off with a towel, leaving a clean bumper!
22) Tin Foil Ball: Replace Dryer Sheets Permanently
Instead of using a dryer sheet ball up one or a few sheets of tin foil and toss it in the

dryer. It removes the static electricity from your clothes and one can last up to a year.
23) Banana Peel: Polish Leather Shoes
Use the inside of a banana peel to give shoes a professional and natural shine that will last for quite some time.
24) Mouthwash: Cure Athlete’s Foot
Pour mouthwash on cotton balls and then swab your feet. The alcohol will disinfect the bacteria completely if you continue this for a week or so.
25) Baking Soda: Clean BBQ Grill
Mix a cup of baking soda with half a cup water to make a paste. Dip your brush into the paste and scrub the grill. The caked on pieces and black residue will come off much quicker and using baking soda is much safer and cheaper than using cleaning chemicals.
26) Coffee Grounds: Fertilizer
Coffee is full of nutrients and vitamins that are very beneficial to soil. That’s why some people include it in compost piles. If you want to get the most out of your coffee, pour the grounds on areas where you want more grass or flowers.
27) Olive Oil: Shaving Cream
The smoothness of the oil can replace the need for shaving cream, and it also provides great moisture.
28) Dryer Sheets: Gets Rid of Static Electricity
Use dryer sheets to remove static electricity from things such as clothing, TV screens or your own hair. Tame fly away strands by running a dryer sheet over them.
29) Freezer: Freeze Candles to Make Them Last Longer
Put candles in the freezer for at least 2 hours before using. Once you burn them, the wax will melt at a much slower pace, making them last much longer!
30) Two glasses of water: Cure Headache
Water is the cure to most common headaches. To make the headache go away quickly, drink two cups of water very quickly.
31) Lemons: Deodorize Garbage Disposal
Toss whole slices of lemon into the garbage disposal then run it. The acidity of the lemon will rid your sink of all odors and leave a fresh scent that usually lasts for a few months.
32) Alka Seltzer: Remove Burnt-On Grease and Food Stains
When letting your pots and pans soak, throw in one or two Alka Seltzer tablets and the caked on residue from cooking will come off easily when you scrub/wash.
33) Apple Cider Vinegar: Relieve Diarrhea
Mix two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar into eight ounces of water to soothe your stomach. The taste may not be the greatest, but the antibacterial properties of the vinegar will end the unpleasantness of the bowel problems.
34) Toothpaste: Remove Scratches from Glass
Apply toothpaste to scratch, then rub with a cloth until the scratch is gone. Make sure the glass is clean beforehand.
35) Cheerios: Relieve Pain from Poison Ivy, Chickenpox and Sunburns
Pound one to four cups of Cheerios into a powder and add to your bath to soothe your skin while you soak. You may not feel relief while in the tub, but you will soon after.
36) Buttons: Sort Earrings
Organize your earrings and prevent them from becoming entangled by using spare buttons as holders for each pair.
37) Corn Oil: Prevent Hairballs for Pets
Add a few drops of corn oil to your pets’ food to prevent hairballs from forming. The thick oil helps the fur pass through the animal’s system much quicker and easily.
38) Whipped Cream: Remove Gum from Hair
There are many remedies for removing gum from hair, but this is a lesser known one. Give it a try rather than peanut butter the next time you’re in need.
39) Coke: Remove Oil Stains from the Driveway
Oil stains are very difficult to remove pavement, but one method guaranteed to work is Coke. The highly acidic drink will eat away at the oil until clean.
40) Brown Sugar: Facial Scrub
A scrub is good to do about once a month to remove dead skin and bacteria built up in pores and remove excess oil from the skin. Brown sugar does just as well as expensive products and will definitely result in a clearer and smoother complexion.
41) Dryer Sheet: Lint Brush
You already know that dryer sheets remove lint in the dryer. Well, it can do the same thing out of the dryer, too. When you’re in a fix, use a dryer sheet. It works just as well as a lint brush, and if you like the scent, it’s an added bo

nus.
42) Newspaper: Deodorize food containers and Food Drawers in the Refrigerator
For that stinky Tupperware or smelly refrigerator drawer that is too much to deal with, toss in a sheet of newspaper overnight before you deal with it. The paper will absorb the smell greatly reducing it or eliminating it completely.
43) Olive Oil: Un-stick a Zipper
The oil will help the zipper slide more easily, fixing the problem!
44) Salt: Cool Something Quickly
You know that feeling when you’re having a BBQ and someone asks for a drink and you realize that no one has put them in the cooler? There’s nothing worse than a warm drink on a hot day. Chill a drink quickly, by adding salt and water to your ice. The drinks will be cold in a matter of minutes; saving your party and making you look smart all at once.
45) Scotch Tape: Prevent Wall from Chipping When Nailing
The wall can leave unsightly chips when hammering in a nail. Prevent this by simply placing a piece of scotch tape over the area you’re going to nail. The wall will be held tighter, preventing chips from occurring.
46) Alka Seltzer: Soothe Insect Bites
Dissolve two tablets into a glass of water. Then use a cloth or cotton ball to apply it to the affected area. The red will go down and most importantly, the itchiness will vanish usually in fifteen minutes.
47) Lemon: Whitens Whites
Add about half a cup of lemon juice to your load of whites to makes them extra white. You can use lemon juice with bleach or detergent, so don’t worry about mixing chemicals with the acidic lemon.
48) Banana Peel: Whiten Teeth
This may sound a little odd, but rub the inside of a banana peel on your teeth twice a day for two weeks and you will receive the same effect from a teeth-whitening kit. Plus, you’ll save yourself money and the hassle of using chemicals.
49) Hair Dryer: Free Photos Stuck on Pages
If you have a photo stuck on a page that you can’t get free, try using a blow dryer on the back of the page. It will loosen the photo from the page and the adhesive holding it there.
50) Banana Peel: Heal Most Skin Problems
Bananas are the magical fruit, because they heal many common problems on the skin. By rubbing the peel on your skin, you can heal bruises and cuts and eliminate rashes, itching and warts. Basically if you have a common skin problem, it can be cured by this fruit.
25/07/18, 21:28 - Kampa Aunt: Did you know that at Harvard, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the most popular and successful course teaches you how to learn to be happier?
The Positive Psychology class taught by Ben Shahar attracts 1400 students per semester and 20% of Harvard graduates take this elective course. According to Ben Shahar, the class - which focuses on happiness, self-esteem and motivation - gives students the tools to succeed and face life with more joy._This 45-year-old teacher, considered by some to be "the happiness guru", highlights in his class 14 key tips for improving the quality of our personal status and contributing to a positive life:

🚩Tip 6. *Face your challenges*: Studies show that the more you postpone something, the more anxiety and tension you generate. Write short weekly lists of tasks and complete them.
🚩Tip 7. *Put everywhere nice memories, phrases and photos of your loved ones*: Fill your fridge, your computer, your desk, your room, YOUR LIFE of beautiful memories.
🚩Tip 8. *Always greet and be nice to other people*: More than 100 inquiries state that just smiling changes the mood.
🚩Tip 9. *Wear comfortable shoes*: If your feet hurt you, you become moody, says Dr. Keinth Wapner, President of the American Orthopedics Association.
🚩Tip 10. *Take care of your posture*: Walk straight with your shoulders slightly backwards and the front view helps to maintain a good mood.
🚩Tip 11. *Listen to music* (Praise God): It is proven that listening to music awakens you to sing, this will make your life happy.
🚩Tip 12. *What you eat has an impact on your mood*:- Do not skip meals, eat lightly every 3 to 4 hours and keep glucose levels stable.- Avoid excess white flour and sugar.- Eat everything! Healthy- Vary your food.
🚩Tip 13. *Take care of yourself and feel attractive*:70% of people say they feel happier when they think they look good.
🚩Tip 14. *Fervently believe in God*: With him nothing is impossible! 
🚩 Tip 15 *Develop a good sense of humour.* Learn to laugh off matters, specially when things don't go right for you.

Happiness is like a remote control, we lose it every time, we go crazy looking for it and many times without knowing it, we are sitting on top of it ...

Have an unconditionally happy life ! 🙏🌹

ಅವರು ಬಂದು ಇದ್ದ ಎರಡು ದಿನ ಕೇವಲ ಎರಡು ನಿಮಿಷದಂತೆಯೇ ಕಳೆದುಹೋದ ಭಾವ. ಹಬ್ಬ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ಹೊರಟ ಮಗಳು ಅಳಿಯನನ್ನು ಇನ್ನೊಂದೆರಡು ದಿನ ಇದ್ದು ಹೋಗುವಂತೆ ಒತ್ತಾಯಿಸುವ ಅಪ್ಪ. ಆದರೂ ಹೊರಡಲೇಬೇಕೆಂಬ ಹಠ ಹಿಡಿದವರ ಒತ್ತಾಯಕ್ಕೆ ಮಣಿದು ಮಗಳಿಗೆ ಅರಿಶಿನ ಕುಂಕುಮ ಕೊಡಲು ಅವ್ವ ತಯಾರು. ಯಾರಿಗೂ ಗೊತ್ತಾಗದಂತೆ ಪಕ್ಕದ ಮನೆಯ ಹಿರಿಯರ ಬಳಿ ಓಡಿ ಸಾಲ ಮಾಡಿ ಸಾವಿರ ರೂಪಾಯಿಯ ನೋಟನ್ನು ಮಡಚಿ ತಂದು ಹೆಂಡತಿಯ ಕೈಗಿಡುವ ಅಪ್ಪ. ಕಣ್ಣಲ್ಲಿ ನೀರು ತುಂಬಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಲೇ ಚಾಪೆ ಮೇಲೆ ಕುಳಿತ ಮಗಳ ಮಡಿಲಿಗೆ ಅಕ್ಕಿ ಹಾಕುತ್ತ ಅರಿಶಿನ ಕುಂಕುಮ ಕೊಟ್ಟು, ಸಾವಿರ ರೂಪಾಯಿಯ ನೋಟನ್ನು ಕೈಗಿಡುತ್ತಾಳೆ ಅವ್ವ.

'ರೈ....ರೈಟ್" ಅನ್ನುತ್ತ ಶಿಳ್ಳೆ ಹಾಕಿದೊಡನೆ ತುಂಬುಬಸುರಿಯಂತೆ ನಿಧಾನವಾಗಿ ಮುನ್ನುಗ್ಗುವ ಕಿಕ್ಕಿರಿದು ತುಂಬಿದ ಉದಯರಂಗ ಬಸ್ಸು. ಬೀದಿಯ ತಿರುವು ಕಾಣುವವರೆಗೂ ಹೋಗುವ ಬಸ್ಸನ್ನೇ ನೋಡುತ್ತ ಕಣ್ಣೊರೆಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತ ಕೈಬೀಸುವ ಅಪ್ಪ ಅಮ್ಮ. ದು:ಖ ಹೇಳಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲಾಗದೇ ಸುಮ್ಮನೆ ಅದೇ ದಿಕ್ಕಿನತ್ತ ಮೂಕವಾಗಿ ನೋಡುವ ನಾಯಿಮರಿ ರಾಜ.
ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಕೇವಲ ಹಣದಲ್ಲೇ ಅಳೆಯಲಾಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಪ್ರೀತಿಯನ್ನೇ ಉಸಿರಾಗಿಸಿಕೊಂಡ ಭಾವುಕರಿಗೆ ಹಣದ ಹಂಗಿರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಕೇವಲ ಭಾವನೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಬೆಲೆಯಿರುತ್ತದೆ ಅಷ್ಟೇ.

End posting Surgery PG clinical exam

The Examiner

'Did you see the case'

'Yes Sir, I did.'

'What is your diagnosis boy?'

'Sir, It is a case of piles (hemarhoids)

'Excellent, now how do you manage the case?'

'Sir the patient is a top end politician so I will refer him to Mayo Clinic in America immediately.'

'Wow, excellent again kid, you have a very bright future ahead.'

'Now tell me what are the complications of piles operation. Immediate and Late.'

'Immediately' the patients relatives could ambush the hospital, attack the staff, strangle the surgeon and sometimes burn the whole place down.'

'Late are facebook and WhatsApp shares, compensation for 1 billion bucks, cancellation of registration or a long long years of prison time.

'Brilliant, all points are perfect and recently advanced and evidence based.'

'One last question, what will you do if you pass the surgery exam.' 

'I will join my father in his agricultural and dairy business and will never ever think of practicing as a doctor, Sir.'

The examiner stood up, clapped his hands, gave the ward a handshake and a hugged him and declared

'You're passed with 100 / 100
Weldon kiddo'

In an evolving world girls/ women are changing... boys/men need to change too...,
For at least two generations now – especially in urban India and educated middle-class families – we have raised our girls to be confident and fight for their rights. 
But we seem to have ignored an entire generation of boys who were not told anything about how their sisters were changing. 
While we gave our daughters new ideals and role models, no one bothered to tell their brothers that they ought to change too!

Girls drive two-wheelers and cars. 
It is considered an essential life skill. You can often hear dads proudly proclaiming that their daughters can drive very well indeed and they don’t need a father/husband/brother to take them anywhere.

However, boys were never taught that cooking is an essential life skill. You don’t see parents proudly saying that their son can cook and doesn’t need a mother/wife/sister to feed him _(and keep him alive!)._

We don’t tell our sons that it is okay for them to be paid less than their wives or stay at home to take care of the kids while their spouses continue to work.

Men want to marry a working woman _(in theory)_ but are completely unprepared for the practical reality of a marriage where both partners work. 
It means doing the dishes or supervising the maid when your wife has a report to complete, it means taking half the day off to take care of your sick son because your wife has an important presentation. It may even mean giving up a promotion or moving to a new city for your spouse’s career.

Because we don’t tell our sons all this, they continue to expect that their wife will automatically give up the job/promotion/transfer in favour of the family whereas they will never have to take a step back from their own careers.

Boys are still raised the way they were for the last many generations.

Women are upset that dinner – and the house, kids, in-laws, maid – is still their responsibility while the men don’t know what they did wrong. After all, they *‘allow’* their wives to work, what more do they want?

*Let us not only empower women, but also prepare men to set their expectations right*.

 ಅಸಾಧಾರಣ ಪ್ರತಿಭೆಗಳ ಸಂಗಮವಾದ ಅವಳಿ ಬಾಲಮುನಿಗಳ ಸಾಧನೆ ಅನಾವರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನ ಅರಮನೆ ಮೈದಾನ ಡಿಸೆಂಬರ್ 2ರಂದು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯಾಗಲಿದೆ. ರಾಜಾಜಿನಗರದ ಶ್ರೀನಾಕೋಡಾ ಪಾಶ್ರ್ವನಾಥ ಜೈನ್ ಶ್ವೇತಂಬರ್ ಮಂದಿರ ಟ್ರಸ್ಟ್ ಹಾಗೂ ಮೆಡಿಟೇಷನ್ ರಿಸರ್ಚ್ ಫೌಂಡೇಷನ್ ವತಿಯಿಂದ ಬೃಹತ್ ಬಾಲಶತಾವಧಾನ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ರಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಅವಳಿ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾನ್ವಿತ ಬಾಲಮುನಿಗಳಾದ ನಮಿಚಂದ್ರಸಾಗರ್ ಮತ್ತು ನೆಮಿಚಂದ್ರಸಾಗರ್ ತಮ್ಮ ಜ್ಞಾಪನಾಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಜನರೆದುರು ಪ್ರಸ್ತುತಪಡಿಸಲಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಆಟ-ಪಾಠಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಕಾಲ ಕಳೆಯುವ ವಯಸ್ಸಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸನ್ಯಾಸ ದೀಕ್ಷೆಯನ್ನು ಪಡೆದಿರುವುದೇ ಒಂದು ಸೋಜಿಗದ ವಿಷಯ ವಾಗಿದೆ.

ಹಲವಾರು ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಕಾಡು ಮೇಡು ಅಲೆದು ಜಪ ತಪಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ದೇವರ ಅನುಗ್ರಹ ಪಡೆಯುವುದರ ಮೂಲಕ ಅಗಾಧವಾದ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಪಡೆದುಕೊಂಡು ಇತಿಹಾಸದ ಪುಟಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಸೇರಿರುವ ಋಷಿ ಮುನಿಗಳ ಸಾಧನೆ ಒಂದಾದರೆ ಇವರೆಲ್ಲರಿಗಿಂತ ವ್ಯತಿರಿಕ್ತವಾಗಿ ಕೇವಲ 10 ವರ್ಷದ ಅವಳಿ ಬಾಲಕರು 10 ಭಾಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತನಾಡುವ ಪ್ರವೀಣತೆಯನ್ನೂ ಸಹ ಹೊಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

ಇಷ್ಟೂ ಸಾಲದೆಂಬಂತೆ ಇವರ ಅಮೋಘವಾದ ನೆನಪಿನ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಕೇಳಿದರೆ ಬಾಯಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಕೈಯಿಟ್ಟು ಕೂರಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. 10 ಭಾಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾವಿರಾರು ಸಭಿಕರ ನಡುವೆ ಏಕಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ 100 ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಅವರದೇ ಭಾಷೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ತರಿಸುವಂತಹ ಚಾಣಾಕ್ಯರಿವರು.
ಭಗವದ್ಗೀತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಎಷ್ಟು ಪಾಠಗಳಿವೆ ಎಂಬುದಕ್ಕೆ ಉತ್ತರಿಸಲು ತತ್ತರಿಸುವ ಎಷ್ಟೋ ಮಂದಿಗಳ ನಡುವೆ ಜೈನ ಧರ್ಮದ 5000 ಶ್ಲೋಕಗಳಲ್ಲದೆ ಭಗವದ್ಗೀತೆ, ಖುರಾನ್, ಬೈಬಲ್, ಗುರುಗ್ರಂಥ ಸಾಹೀಬ್ ಧರ್ಮ ಗ್ರಂಥಗಳ ಕುರಿತು ಯಾವುದೇ ಭಾಗದ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗಳನ್ನು ಯಾವುದೇ ಭಾಷೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕೇಳಿದರೂ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕೇಳಿದಂತಹ ಭಾಷೆಯಲ್ಲೇ ಉತ್ತರಿಸುವಷ್ಟು ಪ್ರತಿಭಾನ್ವಿತರು ಅವರ ನೆನಪಿನ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ನಿಜವಾಗಿಯೂ ಮೆಚ್ಚಲೇಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಕೇವಲ 1ನೇ ತರಗತಿಯವರೆಗೆ ವ್ಯಾಸಂಗ ಮಾಡಿ ನಂತರ ಸನ್ಯಾಸ ದೀಕ್ಷೆಯನ್ನು ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸಿ ಜೈನ ಧರ್ಮದ ಬಾಲಮುನಿಗಳಾಗಿರುವ ಈ ಅವಳಿ ಗುರುಗಳು ಸಂಸ್ಕøತ, ಪ್ರಾಕೃತ, ಹಿಂದಿ, ಗುಜರಾತಿ, ಮರಾಠಿ, ಮಾರ್ವಾಡಿ, ಇಂಗ್ಲೀಷ್, ಪಂಜಾಬಿ, ಕನ್ನಡ, ಉರ್ದು ಭಾಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತನಾಡುವ, ಅರ್ಥಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವಂತಹ ಮಹಾನ್ ಜ್ಞಾನವನ್ನು ಗಳಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

ಗುಜರಾತಿನ ಸೂರತ್ ನಗರದ ತಂದೆ ಪಿಯಷ್‍ಭಾಯ್ ಮತ್ತು ತಾಯಿ ಸೋನಲ್‍ಬೆನ್ ರವರ ಅವಳಿ ಮಕ್ಕಳಾಗಿರುವ ಇವರು, 2 ವರ್ಷ ಗುರುಕುಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಸನ್ಯಾಸ ಜೀವನದ ತರಬೇತಿ ಪಡೆದು 9ನೇ ವಯಸ್ಸಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸೂರತ್ ನಗರದಲ್ಲಿ ಸನ್ಯಾಸ ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸಿದರು. ತದನಂತರ ತಪ, ತ್ಯಾಗ, ಪರಮಾರ್ಥ ಹಾಗೂ ಧ್ಯಾನ ಸಾಧನೆಯ ಮೂಲಕ ಆಧ್ಯಾತ್ಮಿಕ ದಿಕ್ಕಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಉನ್ನತಿ ಸಾಧಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ಇವರು ಬಹುತೇಕ 5,000 ಕಿ.ಮೀ. ದೂರ ಪಾದಯಾತ್ರೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಸನ್ಯಾಸ ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸಿದ ನಂತರ ಅವಳಿ ಬಾಲಮುನಿಗಳು ಕೇವಲ 2:30 ಗಂಟೆಗಳ ಕಾಲ 350 ಪದ್ಯಗಳು ಕಂಠಪಾಠ ಮಾಡಿ ಒಂದು ಹೊಸ ದಾಖಲೆಯನ್ನು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

ಈ ಅವಳಿ ಬಾಲಮುನಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಜೈನ ಧರ್ಮದ 5 ಆಗಮ ಗ್ರಂಥಗಳ 5,000 ಶ್ಲೋಕಗಳ ಜೊತೆ ಭಗವದ್ಗೀತೆಯ ಅಧ್ಯಾಯಗಳು, ಗುರುಗ್ರಂಥ ಸಾಹಿಬ್‍ರ ಪೌರಿಸ್(ಪಾವಡಿಯಾ), ಬೈಬಲಿನ ಅಧ್ಯಾಯಗಳು ಹಾಗೂ ಖುರಾನ್ ಆಯಾತ್ ಭಾಗಶಃ ಕಂಠಪಾಠವಾಗಿದೆ. ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಧರ್ಮದ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಧರ್ಮ ಗ್ರಂಥವನ್ನು ಭಾಗಶಃ ಕಂಠಪಾಠ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ವಿಶ್ವದ ಯಾವುದೇ ದೇಶದ ಹೆಸರನ್ನು ಕೇಳಿ, ದೇಶದ ಹೆಸರಿನೊಂದಿಗೆ ಅದರ ರಾಜಧಾನಿ ಮತ್ತು ಮಾತೃಭಾಷೆಯನ್ನು ಹೇಳಬಲ್ಲವರಾಗಿದ್ದು ಕಣ್ಣಿಗೆ ಪಟ್ಟಿ ಕಟ್ಟಿಕೊಂಡು ಪಿರಾಮಿಡ್ ಕ್ಯೂಬನ್ನು ಸರಿಪಡಿಸ ಬಲ್ಲವರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಭಾರತದ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಪತಿಗಳು, ವಿವಿಧ ರಾಜ್ಯಗಳ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಮಂತ್ರಿಗಳು, ರಾಜ್ಯಪಾಲರು, ಕೇಂದ್ರೀಯ ಸಚಿವರಿಂದ ಪ್ರಶಂಸೆ ಪಡೆದಿರುವ ಇವರನ್ನು ಗುಜರಾತ್ ಕ್ಯಾಬಿನೆಟ್‍ನ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಸಚಿವ ಭೂಪೇಂದ್ರಸಿಂಗ್ ಚುಡಾಸಮಾ ರವರು ಸುವರ್ಣಶಾಯಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬರೆದ ಗೌರವಾನ್ವಿತ ಪತ್ರದಿಂದ ಅವರನ್ನು ಗೌರವಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

07/01/19, 10:40 - Kampa Aunt: ನನ್ನ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಹಿಂದೂ ಅಕ್ಕ, ಅಣ್ಣ, ತಮ್ಮ, ತಂಗಿ ಹಾಗೂ ನನ್ನ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಹಿಂದೂ ಬಾಂಧವರೇ ನಿಮಗೆ ಕೈ ಮುಗಿಯುವೆ🙏🏻. ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು  ಇದನ್ನು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ಓದಿ ಅರ್ಥ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಿ..

ಕಾಲ ಬದಲಾಗಿದೆಯಾ??
      No chance
       ಬದಲಾಗಿಲ್ಲ.  

ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಜಾಲತಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಅನ್ಯ ಧರ್ಮೀಯರ ಜೊತೆ *Selfie* ತೆಗೆಸಿಕೊಂಡ ಹಿಂದೂ ಹುಡುಗಿಯರ ಫೋಟೊಗಳು ಕಾಣಸಿಗುತ್ತವೆ.....
ಆದರೆ, ಹಿಂದೂ ಯುವಕರ ಜೊತೆ ಅನ್ಯ ಧರ್ಮೀಯ ಯುವತಿಯರ *Selfie* ಫೋಟೊಗಳು ಕಾಣಸಿಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಯಾಕೆ?

ಉತ್ತರ ಹೀಗಿರಬಹುದೆ :
ನಮ್ಮ ಅಪ್ಪ, ಅಮ್ಮ, ಮಗಳಿಗೆ ಉತ್ತಮ ಸಂಸ್ಕ್ರತಿ, ಸಂಸ್ಕಾರ ಕಲಿಸಿರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ, ಯಾರ ಭಯವಿಲ್ಲ, ನಮ್ಮ ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ...

ಮಹಿಳೆಯರಲ್ಲಿ ಕ್ಷಮೆ ಕೇಳುತ್ತಾ,
ಒಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ವಿಚಾರ:-

ಕಾಲ ನಮಗಷ್ಟೆ Change ಆಗಿದೆಯಾ...!?
ಇಂದಿಗೂ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಂ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರು *ಬುರ್ಖಾ* ತೊಡುವುದು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದಾರಾ..?
ಕ್ರಿಶ್ಚಿಯನ್ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರು *ಶಿಲುಬೆ* ತೊಡುವುದು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದಾರಾ..?
ಹಿಂದೂ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರು *ಕುಂಕುಮ* ಇಡುವುದನ್ನು, *ಕಾಲುಂಗುರ* ತೊಡುವುದನ್ನು, *ಮಾಂಗಲ್ಯ* ಧರಿಸುವುದನ್ನೇ ಮರೆತಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಅಲ್ಲವೇ?
ಕೇಳಿದ್ರೆ *My life, my rule, my fashion* ನನ್ನ ಇಷ್ಟ ಅಂತಾರೆ....
ಹಿಂದೂ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರಿಗಷ್ಟೆ *fashion* ಇರೋದಾ...?

ಇನ್ನು ಹುಡುಗರ ವಿಚಾರ..
ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮರು *Skull cap, ಟೋಪಿ, ನಮಾಜ್* ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದಾರಾ..?

ಮುಸ್ಲಿಂ ಮಹಿಳೆಗೆ ಬಸ್ಸಿನಲ್ಲಿ  Seat ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಕೊಡೋದು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದಾರ..?

ರಸ್ತೆ ದಾಟಲು ಅನುವು ಮಾಡಿಕೊಡುವುದು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದಾರಾ..?

ನಮ್ *ಹಿಂದೂ ಹುಡುಗರು* atleast ಹಣೆಗೆ *ತಿಲಕ* ಇಡೋದಕ್ಕೂ ಹಿಂದೆ ಮುಂದೆ ನೋಡ್ತಾರೆ..
ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗೋದು ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೊಮ್ಮೆಯಾಗಿದೆ ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ.. ಗೊತ್ತಿರೋದೆ ಅಲ್ವ..?

ನಮ್ಮ *ಹಿಂದೂ ಯುವಕ ಯುವತಿಯರ* *Facebook wall* ನಲ್ಲಿ
*Muslim wishes* ನೋಡಿದಿರಿ *Christmas wishes* ನೋಡಿದಿರಿ...
But *Muslim or Chrisrian fb wall ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಗಣೇಶ, ಹೋಳಿ, ದೀಪಾವಳಿ wishes* ನೋಡಿದೀರಾ..?
ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ..
ಇದನ್ನೆಲ್ಲಾ ವಿಷ್ಲೇಶಿಸಿದಾಗ ನಮಗೆ ತಿಳಿಯೋ ಸತ್ಯ:-
ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ನಾವು ( *parents* ) ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಧರ್ಮ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಕೊಡುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದರ್ಥ.

ನಾವು ಮಕ್ಕಳನ್ನು ಕರೆದುಕೊಂಡು *mall* ಗೆ ಹೋಗುತ್ತೇವೆಯೇ ವಿನಃ ವಾರಂತ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ದೇಗುಲಕ್ಕಲ್ಲಾ.. ಸತ್ಯವಾ?..

ಇದು ಇಂದಿನ *parents* ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ಕೊಡುತ್ತಿರುವ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ... ಸರಿಯೇ...?
ಯಾಕೆ ಬೇರೆಯವರ ತಾಯಿ ನಮಗೂ ತಾಯಿಯಲ್ಲವೇ..

( *So called ಸಾಧಕರು* ) ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಪುಟಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಬರೆಯೋ ನಾವು, ರಾಮನ, ಕೃಷ್ಣನ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಬರೆಯೋದಿಲ್ಲ ಯಾಕ್ ಹೇಳಿ?...
ಅಯ್ಯೋ *ಮುಸ್ಲಿಂ friends* ಬೇಜಾರು ಮಾಡ್ಕೋತಾರೆ ಅಂತಾ... ಅಲ್ವಾ?
ನೋಡಿ ಬಸ್ಸಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಗಂಟೆಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಪ್ರಯಾಣ ಮಾಡ್ತೀವಿ, ಸಿನಿಮಾ ಥಿಯೇಟರ್ ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಗಂಟೆಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಕಳಿತೀವಿ, ಅದೂ ದುಡ್ಡು ಕೊಟ್ಟು... ದುಡ್ಡಿಲ್ಲದೇ ದೇವರ ಮುಂದೆ ಕಾಲು ಗಂಟೆ ಧ್ಯಾನ ಮಾಡೋಕೆ ನಮಗೆ *time* ಇಲ್ಲ.. ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ಕಲಿಸುವ ಮಾತು ಬೇರೆ ಇರಲಿ , ನಮಗೇ ಟೈಮ್ ಇಲ್ಲ.. ಇನ್ನೊಂದು... ಇವೆಲ್ಲಾ 
ನಮ್ಮೊಬ್ಬರ ಕೈಯಿಂದ ಆಗುತ್ತಾ..! ಅಂತೀವಿ... ಯಾಕೀ ಉಡಾಫೆ ಮಾತು..!?
Atleast ನಾವು ನೀವು ಪ್ರಯತ್ನ ಮಾಡೋಣ...

ಇಡೀ ಹಿಂದೂ ಸಮಾಜವನ್ನು ಅಧೋಗತಿಗೆ ತರ್ತಿರೋದು *ನೀವೇ ನೀವೇ ನೀವೇ*.... 

ಹನಿ ಹನಿ ಕೂಡಿದರೆ ಹಳ್ಳ ಅಲ್ಲವೇ...
ತುಂಬಾ ಇದೆ ಹೇಳ್ತಾ ಹೋದ್ರೆ..

ಇಲ್ಲಿಯ ಈ ಮಣ್ಣು ಸಾಧಾರಣ ಮಣ್ಣಲ್ಲ..
ವಿದ್ಯಾರಣ್ಯ, ವಾಲ್ಮೀಕಿಯ ಶುದ್ಧಗೈದು ರಾಮಾಯಣ ಬರೆಸಿದ ಪುಣ್ಯಭೂಮಿ ಇದು..
ಇಲ್ಲಿ ವಿಷ್ಲೇಶಿಸಿರುವ ವಿಷಯ ಸಮಸ್ತ ಹಿಂದೂ ಸಮಾಜದವರಿಗಾಗಿ.. 

ಶೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ, ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ಭಯವೇ? ಸಂಕೋಚವೇ? ಅಳುಕೇ?

*BE PROUD TO BE A HINDU - YOU BELONG TO THE MIGHTIEST, MOST POWERFUL & STRONGEST OF THE NOBLE RELIGIONS THIS WORLD EVER CREATED IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.*

*SUCH A GREAT RELIGION CAN NEVER BE AGAIN CREATED NOR BE DESTROYED BUT WE PEOPLE CAN WEAKEN IT BY OUR NEGLIGENCE.*

*JAI HIND, JAI HINDUSTHAN*

ಆದಷ್ಟು group ನಲ್ಲಿ ಪದೇ ಪದೇ *send* ಮಾಡಿ ನನ್ನ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಅಕ್ಕ, ಅಣ್ಣ ತಮ್ಮಂದಿರಿಗೆ ಹಾಗೂ ನನ್ನ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಹಿಂದೂ ಬಾಂಧವರಿಗೆ ಮುಟ್ಟಬೇಕು..
           💐🙏🇮🇳🙏💐

10/01/19, 16:19 - Kampa Aunt: *_Some Very Interesting Predictions.._*

*1-Auto repair* shops will disappear. 

*2-A petrol/diesel* engine has 20,000 individual parts. An electrical motor has 20. Electric cars are sold with lifetime guarantees and are only repaired by dealers. It takes only 10 minutes to remove and replace an electric motor.

*3-Faulty electric* motors are not repaired in the dealership but are sent to a regional repair shop that repairs them with robots.

*4-Your electric motor* malfunction light goes on, so you drive up to what looks like a car wash, and your car is towed through while you have a cup of coffee and out comes your car with a new electric motor!

*5-Petrol pumps* will go away.

*6-Street corners* will have meters that dispense electricity.  Companies will install electrical recharging stations; in fact, they’ve already started in the developed world.

*7-Smart major* auto manufacturers have already designated money to start building new plants that only build electric cars. 

*8-Coal industries* will go away. Gasoline/oil companies will go away.  Drilling for oil will stop. So say goodbye to OPEC! The middle-east is in trouble.

*9-Homes* will produce and store more electrical energy during the day and then they use and will sell it back to the grid. The grid stores it and dispenses it to industries that are high electricity users. Has anybody seen the Tesla roof?

*10-A baby of today* will only see personal cars in museums. The FUTURE is approaching faster than most of us can handle.

*11-In 1998,* Kodak had 170,000 em- ployees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide. Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. Who would have thought of that ever happening?

*12-What happened* to Kodak and Polaroid will happen in a lot of industries in the next  5-10 years … and most people don't see it coming.

*13-Did you think* in 1998 that 3 years later, you would never take pictures on film again? With today’s smart phones, who even has a camera these days?

*14-Yet digital* cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had  10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law.  So as with all exponential tech- nologies, it was a disappointment for a time, before it became way superior and became mainstream in only a few short years.

*15-It will now happen* again (but much faster) with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs.

*16-Forget the book,* “Future Shock”, welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution.

*17-Software* has disrupted and will continue to disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.

*18-UBER* is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now  the biggest taxi company in the world! Ask any taxi driver if they saw that coming.

*19-Airbnb* is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.   Ask Hilton Hotels if they saw that coming. 

*20-Artificial Intelligence:* Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go-player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected.

*21-In the USA,* young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of  IBM's Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for right now, the basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So, if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, (what a thought!) only omniscient specialists will remain.

*22-Watson* already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, its 4 times more accurate than human nurses.

*23-Facebook* now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. In 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.

*24-Autonomous cars:* In 2018 the first self-driving cars are already here. In the next 2 years, the entire industry will start to be disrupted. You won't want to own a car anymore as you will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination.

*25-You will not need* to park it you will only pay for the driven distance and you can be productive while driving. The very young children of today will never get a driver's license and will never own a car.

*26-This will change* our cities, because we will need 90-95% fewer cars. We can transform former parking spaces into green parks.

*27-About 1.2 million* people die each year in car accidents worldwide including distracted or drunk driving. We now have one accident every 60,000 miles; with autonomous driving that will drop to 1 accident in 6 million miles. That will save a million lives plus worldwide each year. 

*28-Most traditional* car companies will doubtless become bankrupt. They will try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels.

*29-Look at what Volvo* is doing right now; no more internal combustion engines in their vehicles starting this year with the 2019 models, using all electric or hybrid only, with the intent of phasing out hybrid models.

*30-Many engineers* from Volkswagen and Audi; are completely terrified of Tesla and they should be. Look at all the companies offering all electric vehicles. That was unheard of, only a few years ago.

*31-Insurance* companies will have massive trouble because, without accidents, the costs will become cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear.

*32-Real estate* will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will abandon their towers to move far away to more beautiful affordable neighborhoods.

*33-Electric cars* will become mainstream about 2030. Cities will be less noisy because all new cars will run on electricity.

*34-Cities* will have much cleaner air as well.

*35-Electricity* will become incredibly cheap and clean.

*36-Solar production* has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can now see the burgeoning impact.  And it’s just getting ramped up.

*37-Fossil energy* companies are desperately trying to limit access to the grid to prevent competition from home solar installations, but that simply cannot continue - technology will take care of that strategy.

*38-Health:* The Tricorder X price will be announced this year. There are companies who will build a medical device (called the "Tricorder" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breath into it.  It then analyses 54 bio-markers that will identify nearly any Disease. There are dozens of phone apps out there right now for health purposes.

*WELCOME TO TOMORROW* – it actually arrived a few years ago. 

Let us wake up to the 21st century challenges ......

What is your husbands age, & what is your age?

Lady : When we got married my husband was 25 & I was only 18.
Now he is 50 yrs old, that is double...so, accordingly I am 36.

13/02/19, 18:52 - Kampa Aunt: *Die empty*


One of the most beautiful article that I have read in the book called "Die Empty" by Todd Henry.

The author was inspired and got this idea of writing ​​this book while attending a business meeting. 

When the director asked the audience: "Where is the richest land in the world?"


One of the audience answered: "Oil-rich Gulf states." 

Another added: "Diamond mines in Africa."

Then the director said: "No it is the cemetery. Yes, it is the richest land in the world, because millions of people have departed from it, "they have died" and they carry many valuable ideas that did not come out of the light and benefited others. It is all in the cemetery where they were buried."


Inspired by this answer, Todd Henry wrote his wonderful book "Die empty." Where he did his best to motivate people to pour out their ideas and potential energies in their communities and turn them into something useful before it is too late.


The most beautiful of what he said in his book is that: "Do not go to your grave and you carry inside you the best that you have, always choose to die empty."


Die empty is a new expression and unique on its on way, at first glance you will think it is normal.

But I was surprised to know the true meaning of this new expression. 

It is to die empty of all the goodness that is within you. Deliver it before you leave this world. 


If you have an idea perform it.

If you have a knowledge give it out.

If you have a goal achieve it.

Love, share and distribute, do not keep it inside.

Do not keep the goodness inside of you, and die full of ideas and be a delicious meal for the earthworms in the grave.

Most of us live with the stubborn idea that we will always have tomorrow. But sooner or later all of our tomorrows will run out. 


Now I understand the meaning of the words of all the Holy Books "If the Final Hour comes upon one of you while he has in his hand a sapling then let him plant it."

How can we plant a plant when we have reached out last day?

Yes, God wants us to die empty. To live every day like it is the last day. To give the maximum energy to all that we have, and when we work on something we do it the best way. When we create something it should be spectacular.

We should be inspiring, happy, optimistic, and always seek to be empty until our souls rise up to the sky.


Are you empty?

I think we all weigh thousands of tons of goodness, creativity, love and hope that we can give. 

We have not given all of it, except a little.


How I wish that we start the race to give and remove every atom of goodness inside us. We should learn how to find and sustain our passion and generosity, even in tough times. 


Take care.....

Start the race...

21/02/19, 05:50 - Kampa Aunt: *SOME IRONIES THAT*
             *EXIST IN INDIA :*






1.
Politicians *Divide* Us, 
          Terrorists *Unite* Us.
  





2. 
Everyone Is In Hurry ,
But 
*NO ONE* Reaches In Time






3. 
Priyanka Chopra Earned More Money Playing *Mary Kom*, 
Than The Mary Kom Earned In Her Entire Career. 






4. 
Most People Who Fight Over *Gita And Quran*, 
Have Probably Never Read Any Of Them.






5. 
We Rather Spend More On Our Daughter's *WEDDING* 
Than On Her *EDUCATION*






6. 
The *SHOES* That We Wear Are Sold In Air Conditioned Show Rooms,
The *VEGETABLES* That We Eat Are Sold On The Footpaths.






7. 
We Live In A Country Where Seeing A *POLICEMAN* Makes Us Nervous Rather Than Feeling Safe.






8. 
In IAS Exam, A Person Writes A Brilliant 1500 Words Essay About How Dowry Is A Social Evil And *CRACKS THE EXAM* By Impressing Everyone. 
One Year Later His Parents Demand  A Dowry In Crores, Because He Is An IAS Officer.






9. 
Indians Are Obsessed With Screen Guards On Their Smartphones Even Though Most Come With Scratch Proof Gorilla Glass But Never Bother Wearing A *HELMET* While Riding Bikes















      
*One Of The Best Ever Lines :*



                      
Try To Understand People Before Trusting Them

We Are Living In Such A World,
Where Artificial Lemon Flavor Is Used For 
*"WELCOME DRINK"*

*"FINGER BOWL"*

07/03/19, 22:40 - Kampa Aunt: 1. A doctor friend came to me to chat and said that the weather was very hot. Under the sun, it could reach 40 degrees C. 
He said: At 40 degrees, if you drink ice water in an instant, the micro blood vessels could explode. One of his friends just went into the house to wash his feet with cold water. Then his eyes could not see clearly, and he passed out. Only the ears could hear the sound. He was terrified!
2. The temperature in some places has reached 38 degrees C or higher, but the temperature of the body sense should be higher. The danger is not just with drinking ice cold water. The same danger may occur with
even washing hands / washing your face / washing your feet. You must not subject any part of the hot  body to temperature shock with cold water.  You need about 30 minutes to allow the body to cool down and adjusted to the indoor temperature. Drink luke- warm water of  around 34 to 36 degrees C.
3. There is a very strong man. The doctor had examined him in the hospital about three years ago.
He met the man again and was surprised to find that he had a stroke. He was in a bad condition. The man told the doctor, " Recently,  on a hot day, upon returning home,  in order to quickly cool off from the heat, I immediately took a cold shower. I felt that I could not move my jaws properly. I  immediately called an ambulance to send me to the hospital. That saved my life."

 Remember, especially on a hot day, avoid cold water to cool off as it  will cause rapid contraction of blood vessels. 

Adults with young children at home should inform their helpers about this.

 ●The weather is abnormal recently. 
It may be nice to have a cold drink to cool down,  but it is very dangerous!
Avoid gulping down the drink, drink it  slowly.

Please pass this message to your family and friends. 
It may save a life!

10/03/19, 20:24 - Geethathe: ```Beautiful story!! Made me smile 😊
I hope this makes everyone else smile too. 


A man often bought oranges from an old lady.
After they were weighed, paid for and put in his bag, he would always pick one from his bag, peel it, put a segment in his mouth, complain it's sour and pass on the orange to the seller.
The old lady would put one segment in her mouth and retort, "why, it's sweet," but by then he was gone with his bag.
His wife, always with him, asked, "the oranges are always sweet, then why this drama every time?"
He smiled, "the old mother sells sweet oranges but never eats them herself. This way I get her to eat one, without losing her money. That's all."
The vegetable seller next to the old lady, saw this everyday.
She chided, "every time this man fusses over your oranges, and I see that you always weigh a few extra for him. Why?"
The old lady smiled, "I know he does this to feed me an orange, only, he thinks I don't understand. I never weigh extra. His love tilts the scale slightly every time."

Life's joys are in these sweet little gestures of love and respect for our fellow beings.
O God, Grant us always the ability to show such amazing kindness and Gestures 😊```

Western researchers reveal why children who memorize sanskrit mantras become super intelligent as they grow up*

Neuroscience shows how  rigorous memorising can help the brain. The term the ‘Sanskrit Effect’ was coined by neuroscientist James Hartzell, who studied 21 professionally qualified Sanskrit pandits. He discovered that memorising Vedic mantras increases the size of brain regions associated with cognitive function, including short and long-term memory. This finding corroborates the beliefs of the Indian tradition which holds that memorising and reciting mantras enhances memory and thinking.

Dr Hartzell’s recent study raises the question whether this kind of memorisation of ancient texts could be helpful in reducing the devastating illness of Alzheimer’s and other memory affecting diseases. Apparently, Ayurvedic doctors from India suggest it is the case and future studies will be conducted, along with more research into Sanskrit.

While we all know the benefits of mindfulness and meditation practices, the findings of Dr Hartzell are truly dramatic. In a world of shrinking attention spans, where we are flooded with information daily, and children display a range of attention deficit disorders, ancient Indian wisdom has much to teach the West (and their 'modernised' intellectual serfs in the East). 
Even introducing small amounts of chanting and recitation of the common sanskrit mantras like gayatri mantra daily could have an amazing effect on all of our brains.

31/03/19, 07:46 - Kampa Aunt: Have we failed in bringing up.our 'modern' kids?

A very distressed neighbour shared that he had driven home after a long day at work. As he entered, he saw his wife in bed with fever. She had laid out his dinner on a tray.

Everything was there just as he wanted it. The dal, vegetables, salad, green chutney, papad and pickles... *"How caring,"* he thought, *“Even when she is unwell, she finds the strength to do everything for me.”*

As he sat down to eat, he realised that something was missing. He looked up at his grown up daughter who was watching TV and said, *"Beta (child), can you get me my medicine and a glass of water, please?"*

She rolled up her eyeballs to show her displeasure at being disturbed, but did the favour nevertheless.

A minute later he realised that salt was missing in the dal.

He said, *"Sorry beta, can you please get me some salt?"*

She said, *"Ufff!"* and got the salt but her stomping shoes made it clear that she did not appreciate the disruption.

A few minutes later he said, *"Beta …”*

She banged the TV remote on the table and said, *"What is it now Dad? How many times will you make me get up? I too am tired; I had a long day at work!"*

The man said, *"I'm so sorry beta…"*
 Silence prevailed.

The man got up and placed the dishes in the kitchen sink and quietly wiped the tear escaping his eye.

My heart wept... I often wonder; *Why is it that the youngsters of the so called modern world behave like this? Have we given them too much freedom to express? Have we failed to discipline and give them the right values?*

*Is it right to treat children as friends?* Think of it this way, they have lots of friends. But they have only one set of parents. If they don't do 'parenting', who will?

Today the *‘self-esteem’* of even a new born or an infant is being talked about; but what about the self-esteem of the parents? Are they supposed to just fan the egos of their children, while the children don't care two hoots about theirs?

Often parents say, “Aajkal ke bachhe sunte kahaan hain (Where will you find obedient children in these times)?” Why?

The other day, we were at a dinner party. All the seats were occupied except for one bean bag. One of our fifty-something friends told his teenaged daughter to move to the bean bag, so that he could sit on the high back chair she occupied.

She said, *"Why can't you sit on the bean bag?”*

I was zapped; we all knew that the father had a back ailment, and even otherwise… Well!

Later as everyone was taking leave of the host, the same guy realised that he had left his car keys inside. He asked his daughter to go and get them.

*“Why can’t you go and get them yourself? I am not your maid!"*

I looked away in disgust and disbelief. The poor guy had no option but to make light of the situation saying, *"Ya, Ya, but Daddy is your eternal servant my princess!"*

He went inside to fetch the car keys. This is what our social behaviour has become! Why?

If we need to teach children about self-respect, self-esteem and self-confidence, we also need to tell them that howsoever big and rich and famous they may be, their parents shall always be their parents… children can never be their equals, let alone be their bosses! 

*Remember to Pay-*

*RENT - Respect, Empathy, Niceness, and Time!*

*I ALWAYS ADVISE PARENTS TO BE PARENTS AND NOT FRIENDS*. Your kids can have n number of friends but have only ONE set of parents.

 *So don't be afraid to set rules and make the children obey them*

04/05/19, 11:56 - Kampa Aunt: EXTRAORDINARY – IMPORTANCE OF AMAVAYSA 4 MAY 2019, or TODAY

May 4, 2019 Amavaysa is one of the most important days of the century. This particular day is a Saturday with Amavasya or No Moon along with planetary configurations which are amazingly beneficial for mankind.  On this day there are certain important times when we should sit and meditate to achieve our goals. These times are the MITRA muhurat. This  extraordinary MITRA muhurat has come after 300 years and that too six times in one single day.

All of us have longings, desires, hankerings, unfulfilled goals – buying a house, return of loans, friendship with a person who is uncaring, mending of broken relationships, etc.  The  Mitra  Muhurt on 4th May 2019 is the time to fulfill these. There are six specific times during the entire day when there is no pull from the moon and the earth is flooded with intense magnetic vibrations which have a powerful effect on the chakras of our body. During such times when we sit in meditation for two hours (basically long enough to have strong visualization) and focus on our unfilled desires and visualize them as fulfilled, then they are easily fulfilled. Our strong visualization vibrations move upwards and receive strength from the magnetic waves present in the atmosphere and they return back to us as the fulfillment of our goals.

The six periods of time or muhurats when the force of the magnetic waves  are at their heights are: 
3.20 am  - 4.53 am
6.40 am  - 8.40 am
10.50 am - 12.30 pm
3.00 pm - 4.50 pm
7.00 pm - 8.30 pm
10.30 pm - 11. 54 pm

Meditate and visualize the positive outcome of your goals or desires in life during the above times. 

Another important factor to note is to breathe through the right nostril at such times when we meditate. How can we accomplish that? If we lie down for two minutes on the left side, the right nostril will open up and the flow of prana (breath) will be through the right nostril.   

Any work started during these Mitra Muhurat times will be successfully accomplished. Any pooja or meditation or japa during these periods will have effect of a thousand times more.
04/05/19, 11:58 - Surya: Thanks everyone!!😃
04/05/19, 11:59 - Surya: Thanks so much Amma!!

13/05/19, 21:23 - Puneeth: One of the most disturbing stories that we find in the Puranas is the story of Krishna's son Samba, whose mother was the bear-princess, Jambavati.

He dupes his father's junior wives by disguising himself as Krishna and is cursed by Krishna that he will suffer from a skin disease that will enable his wives to distinguish father and son. Samba is cured after he builds temples to the sun. All sun temples in India, from Konark in Odisha to Modhera in Gujarat to Markand in Kashmir, are attributed to this son of Krishna.
 
Samba also attempts to kidnap Duryodhana's daughter and this leads to war between the Kauravas and the Yadavas. Peace is restored, and the marriage is solemnised, only after Balarama, Krishna's elder brother, and Samba's uncle, in a fit of fury threatens to drag Hastinapur into the sea. 

Then there is the story of Samba pretending to be a pregnant woman and duping sages who were visiting Dwaraka. They sages were not amused and cursed Samba that he would give birth to an iron mace that would be responsible for the end of the Yadu clan. 

Must not Krishna's son be as noble and divine and wise and loving as Krishna? But that is not so. Samba comes with his own personality and his own destiny over which Krishna has no influence. Or does he? 

Can we wonder if Samba was a product of his father's neglect? For was not Krishna spending most of his time with Arjuna and the Pandavas and in the politics of Kuru-kshetra?
 
There are hardly any stories of Krishna as father. He is friend, philosopher and guide to Arjuna, but the only stories of father and son are of tension, rage and violence. 

In conversations about corporates, we often forget about the other half of our lives, the personal one. As more and more people are working 24x7, thanks to Internet, and smart devices, the lines between professional and personal, work and life are getting blurred. *In fact, people feel noble when they sacrifice family for work and guilty when they take a holiday to take care of their family*. 

Family is not seen as achievement. Children are not seen as purpose. They are seen as obligations, duties, by-products of existence, even collateral damage.  

We admire leaders who sacrifice family for a 'larger' cause. Like freedom fighters who neglect their wives and children. Like business men and entrepreneurs and consultants who spend most of their time in office.

With the rise of feminism, women are also working. *Parenting has been outsourced to maids, teachers, computers, videogames and grandparents*.

Women who work in the office have not been compensated by their husbands spending more time at home. Instead women are made to feel guilty for not being good mothers. No one questions men for not being good fathers. 

Eventually, the office wins. Absent parents rationalise how office is more important than the children: we need the money, the children eventually grow up, surely our needs are also important. 

*Many great Krishnas in the workplace discover that they have nurtured Samba at home: sons who either follow destructive paths as they seek attention, or sons who make their way away from parents, as they have grown used to not having them around*. 

Who wins?

Corporates were supposed to create wealth for the family. Now families are creating only workers for the corporates. 

We have many more Krishnas in this generation and maybe many Sambas in the next.

05/06/19, 19:21 - Kampa Aunt: Event name - " K O D A C H A D R I "
Places covered - Kodachadri peak, Hidlumane falls, Nagara fort & Devagange ponds.
Dates - 29 & 30 June. ( 28th night departure from Bengaluru ) ** ppl from other cities can join too, revised cost will be provided minus transportation.
FYI - Kodachadri trek is the most famous trek of Karnataka & is located in Shivamogga district. ( 420 kms from Bengaluru ) It's done in two ways, one is a total 08 kms trek to peak via Hidlumane falls through thick forest & return by Jeep Off-roading. Another way is two way Jeep ride to Kodachadri peak & two way Jeep ride to Hidlumane falls. ( Even in case of both way Jeep ride, one will have to walk at least 2 kms, as jeeps can go only till some point ) And in case of this trek, 2 ways trek is not possible & nobody does that bcoz of time constraint. Note - Jeep route & trek route both are different. 

COST - 3400 Rs. Per person.
** Note - Our trips are chepaer compared to all other organizers but don't mistake this as a sign of variation in arrangements made or service provided, the reason our rates are cheaper is - 1. The main reason v started organizing trips was to tackle the over commercialization of tourism, as the leading online media of Karnataka tourism, we feel responsible about this. 2. We don't have to invest in marketing, branding, Google seos, staffs, website maintenance etc.. 

Cost includes - > Transportation from & to Bangalore, Non AC Seater. > Homestay accommodation.** Group sharing basis. > 04 times veg food ( Sat 3, Sun 1 ) , tea, snacks > Jeep ride from peak to base ( ** When u compare the rates with other organizers, keep in mind that the Jeep ride won't be included in their total cost, > Forest permission fees > Local trek guide > Camp fire if weather permits > coordinator from Incredible Karnataka team. > Reach to first aid & basic medicines.

Short itinerary - Leave Bangalore on Friday night at 9 P.M, Reach kodachadri base by 7 A.M, freshen up, have breakfast & start the trek ( ** Total trek distance will be 8 kms approx ) reach Hidlumane falls, have a good time, continue trekking towards Kodachadri peak, reach peak, have lunch, explore the peak, witness the Sunset, then return back to base by jeep. ...reach homestay, have some snacks & tea, enjoy campfire, dinner, retire for the day, next day morning, get ready, finish breakfast, checkout, leave for Nagara fort, explore the fort, visit Devagange ponds, have self sponsored lunch on the way, leave for Bangalore, continue journey, reach Bangalore by 9 P.M.

FYI - > 4 different pickup points & necessary notes will be updated prior travel date.
> Those who not willing to trek can opt for Jeep ride both ways & Jeep ride to Hidlumane falls as well ( In this case 150 rs extra )

08/06/19, 11:20 - Mummy: ಕಾಫಿ ಪ್ರಿಯರಿಗೆ, 

ಶತಾವಧಾನಿ ಗಣೇಶರೊಡನೆ ಒಮ್ಮೆ ಇದ್ದಾಗ ನಡೆದ ಪ್ರಸಂಗ. ಅವರು ಕಾಫಿ ಕುಡಿಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು. ನಾನು ನನಗೆ ಕಾಫಿ ಬೇಡ ಅಂದೆ. ಆಗ ಅವರು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದು - "ಯಾಕಪ್ಪ ಬೇಡ ಅಂಪತೀಯ? ಹಾಲು ಬೆಳ್ಳಗಿರುತ್ತೆ, ಅದು ಗಂಗೆ. ಡಿಕಾಕ್ಷನ್ ಕಪ್ಪಗಿರುತ್ತೆ, ಅದು ಯಮನ ತಂಗಿ ಯಮುನೆ. ಸಕ್ಕರೆ ಕರಗಿ ಗುಪ್ತಗಾಮಿನಿಯಾಗಿರುತ್ತೆ, ಅದು ಸರಸ್ವತಿ. ಹೀಗಾಗಿ, ಕಾಫಿ ತ್ರಿವೇಣಿ ಸಂಗಮವಪ್ಪಾ. ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಗೌರವ ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಬೇಕು." 

ನಾನು ಮರುಮಾತಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಕಾಫಿ ಕುಡಿದೆ!

ಪ್ರತಿನಿತ್ಯವು "ಕಾಫಿ"ಯನ್ನು ಸೇವಿಸುವುದರಿಂದ ಗಂಗಾ ಯಮುನಾ ಸರಸ್ವತೀ ನದೀ ಸ್ನಾನದಂತೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಶರೀರವನ್ನು ಪರಿಶುದ್ಧವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. 
ಮುಂದೆಮಾಡುವ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯಕಾರ್ಯಗಳಿಗೆ ಪ್ರಚೋದಿತವಾಗಿ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ನೀಡುತ್ತದೆ.ಆದ್ದರಿಂದಲೇ ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿರಿಯರು ತ್ರಿವೇಣೀ ಸಂಗಮದಂತಿರುವ ಕಾಫಿಯನ್ನು  "ಕಾಪಿ" ಕಾರುಣ್ಯಸೀಮಾ ಎಂದು ಶ್ಲಾಘಿಸರಬಹುದಲ್ಲವೆ.

If you have your binocs/amateur telescopes, please look up at the sky. 
You will see Saturn, Jupiter and one of the brightest stars Antares. 
Also, you WILL see 3 moons around Jupiter. I kid you not!!

23/06/19, 10:05 - Kampa Aunt: BEWARE SENIOR CITIZENS;*

While booking Train tickets. For travelling in trains Senior citizens have been given concession as below: 

40% Concession in fare for Men over 60 years of age and 

50% Concession for Women over 58 years of age .

The concession was given after much deliberations and discussions as a welfare measure towards senior citizens. 

Now while booking train tickets online through IRCTC, 
now a screen appears at the time of booking with two tricky  option 
for the senior citizens to give up the concession so far availed. 

The screen comes with two option *OK* to give up the concession and *Cancel* to proceed booking with concession. 

YOU MAY THINK THAT 
*OK MEANS THAT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE CONCESSION AND* 
*CANCEL MEANS TO FOREGO THE CONCESSION.*

 IN RAILWAY'S PARLANCE IT IS NOT SO. It should be YES or NO. 

 So they indulge in such jugglery of words to confuse the senior citizens/passengers. 

*Always click CANCEL TO AVAIL THE CONCESSION.* 
Never click OK - 
As IRTC is now using technical words to loose your senior citizen benefits..... Forever 
*Just spread the awareness...* 👍​

17/07/19, 14:08 - Kampa Aunt: His Majesty the king of Bhutan Jigmey Namgyal Wangchuk was coronated as the 5th King of Bhutan in 2008.  A month after the coronation, he made education and health services completely free for his subjects through out the kingdom. In Bhutan no one pays for education and health services. He increased the salaries of the teachers which is more than the bureaucrats. In front of teachers, he never sits on his throne, instead he sits on a normal chair. But he offers higher chair to teachers. In royal functions , there are always few Seats reserved for teachers. The teachers in Bhutan are required to pay the minimum tax.  The main purpose of displaying immense respect to teachers are to encourage better education system in the kingdom. Due to his consistent effort, after ten years, the education system of Bhutan is one of the best in the world. 
The world doesn't need powerful kings and leaders equipped with nuclear bombs, but the world needs wise kings and leaders, who put efforts to make improvement in the lives of people.

23/07/19, 11:24 - Geethathe: *SOME VERY INTERESTING PREDICTIONS ( To what extent it will come true - time only will tell us)

*1-Auto repair* shops will disappear. 

*2-A petrol/diesel* engine has 20,000 individual parts. An electrical motor has 20. Electric cars are sold with lifetime guarantees and are only repaired by dealers. It takes only 10 minutes to remove and replace an electric motor.

*3-Faulty electric* motors are not repaired in the dealership but are sent to a regional repair shop that repairs them with robots.

*4-Your electric motor* malfunction light goes on, so you drive up to what looks like a car wash, and your car is towed through while you have a cup of coffee and out comes your car with a new electric motor!

*5-Petrol pumps* will go away.

*6-Street corners* will have meters that dispense electricity.  Companies will install electrical recharging stations; in fact, they’ve already started in the developed world.

*7-Smart major* auto manufacturers have already designated money to start building new plants that only build electric cars. 

*8-Coal industries* will go away. Gasoline/oil companies will go away.  Drilling for oil will stop. So say goodbye to OPEC! The middle-east is in trouble.

*9-Homes* will produce and store more electrical energy during the day and then they use and will sell it back to the grid. The grid stores it and dispenses it to industries that are high electricity users. Has anybody seen the Tesla roof?

*10-A baby of today* will only see personal cars in museums. The FUTURE is approaching faster than most of us can handle.

*11-In 1998,* Kodak had 170,000 em- ployees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide. Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. Who would have thought of that ever happening?

*12-What happened* to Kodak and Polaroid will happen in a lot of industries in the next  5-10 years … and most people don't see it coming.

*13-Did you think* in 1998 that 3 years later, you would never take pictures on film again? With today’s smart phones, who even has a camera these days?

*14-Yet digital* cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had  10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law.  So as with all exponential tech- nologies, it was a disappointment for a time, before it became way superior and became mainstream in only a few short years.

*15-It will now happen* again (but much faster) with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs.

*16-Forget the book,* “Future Shock”, welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution.

*17-Software* has disrupted and will continue to disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.

*18-UBER* is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now  the biggest taxi company in the world! Ask any taxi driver if they saw that coming.

*19-Airbnb* is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.   Ask Hilton Hotels if they saw that coming. 

*20-Artificial Intelligence:* Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go-player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected.

*21-In the USA,* young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of  IBM's Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for right now, the basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So, if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, (what a thought!) only omniscient specialists will remain.

*22-Watson* already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, its 4 times more accurate than human nurses.

*23-Facebook* now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. In 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.

*24-Autonomous cars:* In 2018 the first self-driving cars are already here. In the next 2 years, the entire industry will start to be disrupted. You won't want to own a car anymore as you will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination.

*25-You will not need* to park it you will only pay for the driven distance and you can be productive while driving. The very young children of today will never get a driver's license and will never own a car.

*26-This will change* our cities, because we will need 90-95% fewer cars. We can transform former parking spaces into green parks.

*27-About 1.2 million* people die each year in car accidents worldwide including distracted or drunk driving. We now have one accident every 60,000 miles; with autonomous driving that will drop to 1 accident in 6 million miles. That will save a million lives plus worldwide each year. 

*28-Most traditional* car companies will doubtless become bankrupt. They will try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels.

*29-Look at what Volvo* is doing right now; no more internal combustion engines in their vehicles starting this year with the 2019 models, using all electric or hybrid only, with the intent of phasing out hybrid models.

*30-Many engineers* from Volkswagen and Audi; are completely terrified of Tesla and they should be. Look at all the companies offering all electric vehicles. That was unheard of, only a few years ago.

*31-Insurance* companies will have massive trouble because, without accidents, the costs will become cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear.

*32-Real estate* will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will abandon their towers to move far away to more beautiful affordable neighborhoods.

*33-Electric cars* will become mainstream about 2030. Cities will be less noisy because all new cars will run on electricity.

*34-Cities* will have much cleaner air as well.

*35-Electricity* will become incredibly cheap and clean.

*36-Solar production* has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can now see the burgeoning impact.  And it’s just getting ramped up.

*37-Fossil energy* companies are desperately trying to limit access to the grid to prevent competition from home solar installations, but that simply cannot continue - technology will take care of that strategy.

*38-Health:*  The Tricorder X price will be announced this year. There are companies who will build a medical device (called the "Tricorder" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breath into it.  It then analyses 54 bio-markers that will identify nearly any Disease. There are dozens of phone apps out there right now for health purposes.

*WELCOME TO TOMORROW*  – it actually arrived a few years ago.

01/09/19, 09:18 - Baava: My next few messages are rants on Indian economy..you can  ignore if  not interested
01/09/19, 09:18 - Baava: Fastest growing economies in Asia:

Bangladesh - 8.13%
Nepal - 7.9%
Bhutan - 7.4%
China - 6.9%
Myanmar - 6.8%
Philippines - 6.7%
Malaysia - 5.9%
Pakistan - 5.4%
Indonesia - 5.1%
India - 5%
01/09/19, 09:19 - Baava: The 5% GDP is the "real" GDP..adjusted for inflation..when u look at "nominal" rate, unadjusted for inflation, it is actually the lowest in 7 yrs..that is very very scary
01/09/19, 09:19 - Baava: <Media omitted>
01/09/19, 09:20 - Baava: This is all self inflicted..Started with demonetization (it was a very very bad idea, not just poorly implemented,,) and shoddy implementation of GST( probably a good idea, but not for federalists like me)
01/09/19, 09:22 - Baava: And all this while US economy and most of world economy was doing well. The worst is yet to come..probably second half of 2020 when the long due recession hits..<end of rant ..let's go back to art 370, triple talaq and bomb a few trees in Pakistan>

11/09/19, 11:04 - Baava: Clueless FM. It's all round regrowth in 2 wheelers, tractors, biscuits, toothpaste etc. People are no longer confident abt the their economic future. That is how recession starts..also know as the paradox of thrift..one person's spending is another's income. If many ppl stop spending, we are looking at a huge slowdown..but issue is we can't solve a problem unless we acknowledge it exists..and this govt is incompetent and arrogant

Husband: 
Earlier you were *36-24-36.* 
But now you are
*48-40-48.* 
Though you have everything bigger than before, your value has become less than before. 
This is *INFLATION .😜*

*Economics is not that difficult if we have the right examples.*🤪
Interviewer: What is Recession? 
Candidate: When *"Wine & Women" get replaced by "Water & Wife", that critical phase of life is called Recession!!😜*

*Accountancy fact:*😲😜🤪
What is the *difference between Liability & Asset?*😝
A drunk friend is liability.
But,
A drunk Girlfriend is an Asset.
😜😜😜😜😜

*An Economist beautifully explained two reasons for having 2 wives.*😝😜
A- Monopoly should be broken.
B- Competition improves the quality of service.
If u have 1 wife, She fights with u!
If u have 2 wives, They will fight for you!!🤣🤣🤣

Wonders happen.

12/09/19, 20:17 - Kampa Aunt: Bank of India Launches QR Based Cash Withdrawal System

The Bank of India has introduced a new system that does not require ATM cards to withdraw cash anymore. With this, the bank has killed two birds with one stone, one being an attempt at curbing ATM cloning, skimming and ATM-related frauds, the other one promoting card-less cash withdrawals.

28/09/19, 08:49 - Kampa Aunt: 🌸 LETTER TO A SISTER - FOR YOU DEAR SISTER
 
A woman was sitting on a sofa, drinking iced tea with her mother.
As they talked about life, marriage, responsibilities and obligations of adulthood, the mother then stared at her daughter and said....

'Never forget your sisters,' she warned. They will become increasingly important over time. No matter how much you love your husband, no matter how much you love the children you have, you're going to need them!

'Remember to go to them always, do things with them always'. 'Remember that when I speak of your sisters, I mean ALL women ... your friends, your daughters, and all other women who are attached to you. You'll need them'.

She followed what her mother told her. She kept in touch with her sisters and she had more and more friends over the years. As the years passed by, she gradually understood what her mother was referring to.

As time and nature present their changes and mysteries in a woman's life, your true sisters always remain.

After years of living in this world, this is what I have learned:
          Time goes by.
          Life happens.
          Distances separate.
          The children grow up.
          Passion decreases.
          Our parents die.
          Colleagues forget favors.
          Careers come to an end. 
           etc....
BUT..........
          
Your sisters are always there, no matter how long or how many miles are between you. A sister is never too far away to get to her when you need her.

When you have to walk through a lonely valley and have to do it for yourself, the women of your life will be around, encouraging you, praying for you, pushing you, intervening for you, and waiting for you with open arms at the end of the road. Sometimes they will even break the rules and walk by your side ... or they will carry your load. 

Friends, grandmothers, mothers, mothers-in-law, aunts,daughters,daughters-in-law, granddaughters,cousins, nieces: they are all your 'sisters' and are a blessing in life!
Every day, we continue to need them.

Send this message to all the women who continue to give meaning to your life.

I JUST DID!

The lady who reads this is my Sister, she is beautiful and strong, and I love her. I will help her live her life to the fullest. Help her to shine in the darkest places. Protect her at any time, pick her up when she needs me most, and let her know when she walks with me, she will always be safe.

Send it to the sisters in your life💕

14/10/19, 10:22 - Sinchana: Hello all. Checked for the flights availability for Dec 6,7,8. Round journey with the departure Thursday night and return Sunday noon is coming upto ₹6900. 
Alternatively, if we can shift our trip by one day i.e., start Friday night and return Monday night will cost ₹5500 per person.
14/10/19, 10:23 - Sinchana: Pls let me know ur views on this since flight charges are changing every hour
14/10/19, 10:23 - Sinchana: Another option we can consider is train to Dharwad (night journey) and take a taxi (2h) to Palolem
14/10/19, 10:25 - Geethathe: Are room available for the same  dates
14/10/19, 10:27 - Sinchana: At the moment we have some hotels shortlisted. But based on the dates we need to negotiate with the hotel guys and finalise
14/10/19, 10:33 - Dimpakka: We can probably take a train while going and a flight while coming back
14/10/19, 11:05 - Sinchana: <Media omitted>

14/10/19, 11:11 - Dimpakka: We are ok for Dec 7,8,9👍🏻
14/10/19, 11:12 - Dimpakka: Prefer to come back by flight
14/10/19, 11:14 - Puneeth: 👍🏻
14/10/19, 11:16 - Puneeth: I haven’t checked the options of train. Considering there will be significant travel time from railway station to resort, what are the travel options and costs? Would it be still significantly lower than the flight + cab to resort?
14/10/19, 11:18 - Kampa Aunt: Iam also ok for 7, 8, 9👍🏼
14/10/19, 11:19 - Sugama: We are fine with Dec 7,8,9
14/10/19, 11:36 - Dimpakka: 9hr 35 min from Mys to Dharwad and from Dharwad to South Goa 4hrs
Around 9 hrs from Blr to Dharwad and again 4hrs to South Goa train rates are very cheap compared to flight it is 1100 for 2AC
14/10/19, 11:36 - Amshu: Okay for 7,8,9
14/10/19, 11:36 - Dimpakka: But we will have to travel separately from Mys and Blr
14/10/19, 11:38 - Arpith: 789 ok
14/10/19, 11:38 - Puneeth: That’s a good option. But I remember you or Navin Bhaava  had mentioned about your colleague who travels like this. Any idea What is the cost for taxi from dharwad to Palolem Beach?
14/10/19, 11:39 - Dimpakka: Will check and confirm back on the rates and if we need to do pre booking
14/10/19, 12:36 - Dimpakka: It will cost around 4k for 6seater,we will have to hire 3 of them.Navin is checking for 19 seater Traveller probably will work out much cheaper
14/10/19, 12:37 - Dimpakka: Also even from Airport to palolem beach it would cost 2k for 6 seater
14/10/19, 12:51 - Manumama: Please avoid Monday
14/10/19, 12:51 - Manumama: Return on Sunday fine

19/10/19, 10:18 - Kampa Aunt: Have we failed in bringing up our 'modern' kids?
〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰
(By Narayana Murthy: INFOSYS)

A very distressed neighbour shared that he had driven home after a long day at work. As he entered, he saw his wife in bed with fever. She had laid out his dinner on a tray.

Everything was there just as he wanted it. The dal, vegetables, salad, green chutney, papad and pickles... “How caring," he thought, “Even when she is unwell, she finds the strength to do everything for me.”

As he sat down to eat, he realised that something was missing. He looked up at his grown up daughter who was watching TV and said, “Beta (child), can you get me my medicine and a glass of water, please?"

She rolled up her eyeballs to show her displeasure at being disturbed, but did the favour nevertheless.

A minute later he realised that salt was missing in the dal.

He said, “Sorry beta, can you please get me some salt?"

She said, “Ufff!" and got the salt but her stomping shoes made it clear that she did not appreciate the disruption.

A few minutes later he said, “Beta …”

She banged the TV remote on the table and said, “What is it now Dad? How many times will you make me get up? I too am tired; I had a long day at work!"

The man said, “I'm so sorry beta…"
Silence prevailed.

The man got up and placed the dishes in the kitchen sink and quietly wiped the tear escaping his eye.

My heart wept... I often wonder; “Why is it that the youngsters of the so called modern world behave like this? Have we given them too much freedom to express? Have we failed to discipline and give them the right values?”.

“Is it right to treat children as friends?” Think of it this way, they have lots of friends. But they have only one set of parents. If they don't do 'parenting', who will?

Today the “self-esteem’” of even a new born or an infant is being talked about; but what about the self-esteem of the parents? Are they supposed to just fan the egos of their children, while the children don't care two hoots about theirs?

Often parents say, “Aajkal ke bachhe sunte kahaan hain (Where will you find obedient children in these times)?” Why?

The other day, we were at a dinner party. All the seats were occupied except for one bean bag. One of our fifty-something friends told his teenaged daughter to move to the bean bag, so that he could sit on the high back chair she occupied.

She said, “Why can't you sit on the bean bag?”

I was zapped; we all knew that the father had a back ailment, and even otherwise… Well!

Later as everyone was taking leave of the host, the same guy realised that he had left his car keys inside. He asked his daughter to go and get them.

“Why can’t you go and get them yourself? I am not your maid!"

I looked away in disgust and disbelief. The poor guy had no option but to make light of the situation saying, “Ya, Ya, but Daddy is your eternal servant my princess!"

He went inside to fetch the car keys. This is what our social behaviour has become! Why?

If we need to teach children about self-respect, self-esteem and self-confidence, we also need to tell them…that howsoever big and rich and famous they may be, their parents shall always be their parents… children can never be their equals, let alone be their bosses! 

Remember to Pay-

RENT - Respect, Empathy, Niceness, and Time!

I ALWAYS ADVISE PARENTS TO BE PARENTS AND NOT FRIENDS. Your kids can have n number of friends but have only ONE set of parents.

 So don't be afraid to set rules and make the children obey them.

24/10/19, 06:44 - Kampa Aunt: Dear Friends!

I am Dr. Bhawna I am working as Councillor for paediatric surgery (PGI).
I would like to make a small request to you.
Before that, I would like to share a small piece of information with you.
Many of you might have read today's newspapers that
EMRI results say, majority of people having Heart Attack are less than 50 years old.
*You will be surprised to know the culprit is Palm Oil. It's far far more dangerous than Alchol and Smoking put together.*
*India is the highest importer for Palm oil in this world.*
The Palm oil mafia is very very big.
*Our children, who are the future, are at a big risk.*
There is no fast food available in this country without Palm Oil.
If you *go to our grocery store, try to pick up a children's edible food without Palm oil - you will not succeed.*
You will be interested to know *even Biscuits of big companies are made from it, and similarly all chocolates*. We are made to believe they are healthy, but we never knew about *the killer Palm oil or Palmitic acid*
The big companies like *Lays use different oil in Western Countries and Palm oil in India* just because it is Cheap.
Each time our child eats a product with Palm Oil, the brain behaves inappropriately and signals to secrete fat around and in the Heart  *This leads to Diabetes at a very young age.*
The World Economic Form has projected that 50 percent of people who Die at young age will die of Diabetes and Heart Disease.
*The Palm Oil mafia has made our Children addicted to Junk Food, leaving the fruits and Vegetables aside, which are Heart protective.*
Next time you buy something for your child, see the label of the product. If it has Palm oil or Palmolienic oil or Palmitic acid, avoid buying it! 
We, have written to our Hon'ble Prime Minister  and are also in the process of making similar letters from 1 Lakh Doctors across India to take some action to secure our future generations.
Once again I want to emphasize on impending danger to our children.

Pls protect our Children. They are the future of our Country! Please forward this message.

Don't forget to forward this to your close friends and family members. Please note to send.  as many persons as possible.

10/11/19, 20:53 - Kampa Aunt: <Media omitted>
10/11/19, 21:14 - Kampa Aunt: 👆The practices widely used by Indian Brahmins all over using a Holy Grass named Dharbham or Dharbai,  in all functions, auspicious or inauspicious, a performing person needs to wear a ring made of this Dharbham. But many have lost the reason of why it is to be used in the first place. 
A Doctor named Sadhashiv Rao, took out a bunch of the Dharbham went straight to the clinic to take an x-ray of his palm,by covering his handwith the Dharbham. To his utter surprise,he found that the grass absorbed about 60% of the radiation! When the so powerful X-ray radiation can be absorbed by the Holy Grass, why can it not absorb the ill radiations spread over the atmosphere?
During the Eclipse time,these Dharbham are used to cover all food items to protect them from the harmful ultra violet radiation.
Whenever any function is held,firstly they perform a site-cleansing act known as “Sudhhi Punyaahavachanam”.
While reciting the selective versus,they hold the Dharbham bunch in their hand and placing the tip point of it over the vessel containing water.
Thus the recited vibration values are absorbed by water in the vessel through the Dharbham.
They found that the Holy Grass known as Dharbham has the highest value in conducting the phonetic vibrations through its tip.
Later, they sprinkle the Holy water at every nook and corner of the place,where the function is held.
A Dharbham without the tip is considered of no value, as theconductor-type value is lost in it.

With Sanskrit phonetic sound and vibration,using the Dharbham increases its value.

It is really a marvel, that in those days of Vedic Era,the Sages & Saints of Hindu land used to control the Magnetic path disturbances,just by simply using this Dharbham!

Dharbam only grows naturally at selective places and available almost in every state in India.

If it is kept for a longer time, say for more than six months,then it loses it value and the power of absorbing the radiation or magnetic path control values.

Dharbham cannot just be plucked straight or cut on any day; There is a specific Slokha that is to be recited before cutting it.
That too it can be cut only on the day next to Full Moon - known as Krishna Paksha Pradamai.
A Dharbham without its tip portion is not to be used for making a Ring like item known as "Pavithram".

04/12/19, 23:58 - Puneeth: Today I was at the Attari - Wagah border to see the Beating Retreat border ceremony. Every evening before sunset the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) and the Pakistan Rangers lower their flags over an elaborate ceremony which is a treat to watch. Each side tries to intimidate the other by marching faster, stomping more louder and raising their legs higher than the other through choreographed moves. It was a real treat to watch. Patriotism hits the peak, with goosebumps right from the start. Some of you might have witnessed this, and if you haven’t yet, then there is something to look forward to once in your life.

24/01/20, 11:00 - Sugama: Depth and breadth of stupidity 😅
24/01/20, 11:08 - Surya: Far beyond anybody’s comprehension 🤣
24/01/20, 11:13 - Arpith: I think he's onto something here.. 🧐
24/01/20, 11:14 - Baava: I will explain in detail once I get access to the book that guy is holding
24/01/20, 11:24 - Sugama: 🤣
24/01/20, 11:25 - Baava: Yes. It has the annotated notes of the class. The video is just Q&A post the class

01/02/20, 13:10 - Baava: 0-2.5 lacs-0%

2.5-5 lacs-5%

5-7.5 lacs-10%

7.5-10 lacs-15%

10-12.5 lacs-20%

12.5-15 lacs-25%

Above 15 lacs-30%
01/02/20, 13:31 - Baava: New optional income tax rates for individuals who forego exemptions:
10% for RS 5-7.5 lakh income
(20% now) 
15% for RS 7.5-10 lakh
(20% now)
20% for 10-12.5 lakh
(30% now)
25% for RS 12-15 lakh
(30% now)
No change for more than RS 15 lakh
No tax on upto Rs 5 lakh
01/02/20, 18:57 - Baava: The alternate tax system has six different slabs starting from 2.5 lakh to 15 lakh. In alternate tax if your income is upto 5 lakhs then your income is exempt from any kind of tax, if your income exceeds Rs 5 lakhs then you will have 2.5 lakh tax slab coming to play.
01/02/20, 18:58 - Baava: <Media omitted>
01/02/20, 18:58 - Baava: The new rule allows you to choose between the existing taxation system and the new (alternate) taxation system, whichever works for you. If you are opting for alternate taxation then you will not be able to claim any deductions
01/02/20, 18:59 - Baava: All the deductions under Chapter VI A of income tax are not allowed in alternate taxation system barring some.

The exclusions include

ELSS investments,
PPF LIC (under 80 C),
Medical Insurance (80 D),
Interest paid on Housing Loan, Education Loan  and Electric Vehicle Loan (80 E),
01/02/20, 19:00 - Baava: More importantly House Rent Allowance and Standard Deductions also form the part of the exclusions.

Basically, you can’t claim any of these exemptions if you want the “lower” slab rates.

To add more the Sodexo coupons (which were earlier tax free) will now form part of taxable income in the alternate taxation system

Now it gets important to know what is included. The only part included in this one is if your employer is contributing to National Pension Scheme, you can ask the employer to pay on your behalf a maximum of Rs. 750,000 per year which will not be taxed. (Currently any amount paid by the employer is not taxed)
01/02/20, 19:00 - Baava: Do I Save Tax If I Move to The New Slabs?
The short answer, for the most part is: No
01/02/20, 19:00 - Baava: Only a person, living in an owned house, with no housing loan, no kids, no employee PF or mandatory NPS, will see a reduction in taxes.

The taxation might vary according to individual tax payers contribution under various headers. If a tax payer just claims HRA and utilises is 80 C deductions, then he will be saving lot more in the existing taxation system then migrating to alternate tax regime.
01/02/20, 19:01 - Baava: <Media omitted>
01/02/20, 19:03 - Baava: The most ludicrous budget in decades from direct taxes perspective...beware of WhatsApp fwds from the party cell claiming the 2 option tax system saves a lot of tax and is a game changer..it has only complicated existing system
01/02/20, 19:08 - Baava: This is precisely the reason I advise not to base long term investment plans based on taxation rules..as they can always change...and with idiotic govts like this one, we can be assured of complex changes
01/02/20, 20:29 - Puneeth: <Media omitted>
01/02/20, 20:37 - Baava: Year after year Modi offers the urban middle class nothing in the budget, yet they remain his most loyal supporters, even as they are being shafted by the economic downturn. Some people still think the middle class embraced Modi in 2014 (& dislikes Comgress) for economic reasons..
01/02/20, 20:38 - Baava: They have no incentive to go after revival of economy.   W
Most voted for them for their bigotry and they are doing very well there..
01/02/20, 20:40 - Baava: When history judges us, we will all be held in poor light..like we judge the Germans of the 1930s and 40s

13/02/20, 14:29 - Kampa Aunt: *ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಬ್ಬರೂ ಜೀವ ಉಳಿಸುವ ಬಗೆಗೆ ಇರುವ ಈ ಪ್ರಯೋಜನಕಾರಿ ಸಂದೇಶವನ್ನು ರವಾನಿಸಲೇಬೇಕು ! ಇದೂ ಒಂದು ರೀತಿಯ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಕೆಲಸ*

ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಇದನ್ನು ಮುಂದೆ ಕಳುಹಿಸಿ , ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಇದು ಕೇವಲ ಇತರರನ್ನು ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ ನಿಮ್ಮನ್ನೂ ಸಹ ಉಳಿಸಬಹುದು!

ಜೀವ ಉಳಿಸುವ ದಾರಿಗಳು :

1. *ಉಸಿರುಗಟ್ಟುವುದು - ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕೈಗಳನ್ನು ಎತ್ತಿದರೆ ಸಾಕು*

ಅಮೆರಿಕದ ನ್ಯೂ ಜರ್ಸಿಯಲ್ಲಿ , 5 ವರ್ಷದ ಬಾಲಕನೊಬ್ಬನು , ಚಾಣಕ್ಯತೆಯೊಂದಿಗೆ ತನ್ನ ಅಜ್ಜಿಯ ಜೀವವನ್ನು ಸರಳವಾಗಿ ಕೈಗಳನ್ನು ಎತ್ತುವುದರ ಮೂಲಕ ಉಳಿಸಿದನು.
ಅವನ 56 ವರ್ಷದ ವೃದ್ಧ ಅಜ್ಜಿ ದಿಲಿಹುವ ಎನ್ನುವಾಕೆ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹಣ್ಣುಗಳನ್ನು ತಿನ್ನುತ್ತಾ ಟಿವಿ. ವೀಕ್ಷಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು.
ಆಕೆ ತನ್ನ ತಲೆಯನ್ನು ತಿರುಗಿಸಿದಾಗ , ಹಣ್ಣಿನ ಚೂರೊಂದು ಆಕೆಯ ಗಂಟಲಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಲುಕಿಕೊಂಡಿತು. ಆಕೆ ಅದನ್ನು ಹೊರತೆಗೆಯಲು ತನ್ನ ಎದೆ ಬಡಿದುಕೊಂಡಳು , ಆದರೆ ಅದು ಸಹಾಯಕವಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಹುಡುಗ ಕೇಳಿದ : "ಅಜ್ಜಿ , ಉಸಿರುಗಟ್ಟುತ್ತಿದೆಯೇ ?", ಆಕೆಗೆ ಉತ್ತರಿಸಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಅವನು "ನನಗನಿಸಿದಂತೆ ನಿನಗೆ ಉಸಿರುಗಟ್ಟುತ್ತಿದೆ ಅಜ್ಜಿ , ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕೈಗಳನ್ನು ಎತ್ತಿ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕೈಗಳನ್ನು ಎತ್ತಿ." ಎಂದನು. ಆ ಅಜ್ಜಿ ಅವನು ಹೇಳಿದಂತೆಯೇ ಮಾಡಿದಳು, ಹಾಗು ನಿಜವಾಗಿಯೂ ಆ ಹಣ್ಣಿನ ಚೂರನ್ನು ಹೊರಹಾಕಿದಳು.!
ಆಕೆಯ ಮೊಮ್ಮಗ ಶಾಂತನಾಗಿ , ಇದನ್ನು ನಾನು ಶಾಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಲಿತದ್ದೆಂದು ಹೇಳಿದನು.

2. *ನಡೆಯುವುದರಿಂದ ಮೈ ಕೈ ನೋವು*
ನೀವು ಬೆಳಿಗ್ಗೆ ಏಳುವಾಗ ಮೈ ಕೈ ನೋವನ್ನು ಅನುಭವಿಸುತ್ತೀರಾ ? ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕುತ್ತಿಗೆ ಹಿಡಿದುಕೊಂಡು ಅಥವಾ ನೋವಾಗುತ್ತಿರುತಗದೆಯೇ ? ಈ ರೀತಿಯ ಸಂಧರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ನೀವು ಏನು ಮಾಡಬೇಕು ? 
ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕಾಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಮೇಲಕ್ಕೆತ್ತಿ!
ನಿಮ್ಮ ಹೆಬ್ಬೆರೇಳುಗಳನ್ನು ಎಳೆಯಿರಿ, ಮೆಲ್ಲಗೆ ಉಜ್ಜಿ ಹಾಗೂ ಎರಡೂ ರೀತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ತಿರುಗಿಸಿ.

3. *ಪಾದ/ಕಾಲಿನ ಸೆಳೆತ*
ನಿಮ್ಮ ಎಡಗಾಲಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸೆಳೆಯುತ್ತಿರುವಾಗ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಬಲಗೈಯನ್ನು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದಷ್ಟು ಮೇಲೆತ್ತಿ.
ನಿಮ್ಮ ಬಲಗಾಲಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸೆಳೆಯುತ್ತಿರುವಾಗ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಎಡಗೈಯನ್ನು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದಷ್ಟು ಮೇಲೆತ್ತಿ.

4. *ಪಾದದ ಮರಗಟ್ಟುವಿಕೆ*
ನಿಮ್ಮ ಎಡಗಾಲು ಮರಗಟ್ಟಿದರೆ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಬಲಗೈಯನ್ನು ವೇಗವಾಗಿ ತಿರುಗಿಸಿ.
ನಿಮ್ಮ ಬಲಗಾಲು ಮರಗಟ್ಟಿದರೆ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಎಡಗೈಯನ್ನು ವೇಗವಾಗಿ ತಿರುಗಿಸಿ.

【 ಮೂರು ರಕ್ಷಣಾ ವಿಧಾನಗಳು 】

1. *ಅರ್ಧ ದೇಹದ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವವಾಯು* . ( ಮಿದುಳಿನ ರಕ್ತಸ್ರಾವ ಅಥವಾ ಮುಚ್ಚಿದ ರಕ್ತನಾಳಗಳ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದಾಗಿ ಸಂಭವಿಸುವ ಪಾರ್ಶ್ವವಾಯುವನ್ನು ಹೊರತುಪಡಿಸಿ),
ಅರ್ಧ ಮುಖವು ಇಳಿಬೀಳುವಾಗ. ತಕ್ಷಣ ಒಂದು ಸೂಜಿಯನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡು ರೋಗಿಯ ಎರಡೂ ಕಿವಿಗಳ ತುದಿಯನ್ನು ಚುಚ್ಚಿ ಒಂದು ಹನಿ ರಕ್ತವನ್ನು ಹಿಂಡಿ ಹೊರತೆಗೆಯಿರಿ. ರೋಗಿ ತಕ್ಷಣ ಗುಣಮುಖನಾವರು, ಹಾಗೂ ರೋಗದ ಯಾವುದೇ ಲಕ್ಷಣಗಳನ್ನು ಮುಂದೆ ತೋರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ.

2. *ಹೃದಯಾಘಾತದಿಂದಾಗಿ ಹೃದಯಸ್ತಂಭನ*
ತಕ್ಷಣ ರೋಗಿಯ ಕಾಲುಚೀಲಗಳನ್ನು ತೆಗೆಯಿರಿ, ಹಾಗು ಒಂದು ಸೂಜಿಯಿಂದ ಕಾಲುಗಳ ಹತ್ತು ಬೆರೆಳುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಂದನ್ನೂ ಚುಚ್ಚಿ , ಒಂದೊಂದು ಹನಿ ರಕ್ತವನ್ನು ಹೊರಗೆ ಹಿಂಡಿರಿ. ಅನಂತರ ರೋಗಿಯು  ಮೇಲೇಳುವರು.

3. *ರೋಗಿಗೆ ಉಸಿರಾಡಲು ಕಷ್ಟವಾಗುತ್ತಿರುವಾಗ* - ಆಸ್ತಮಾ ಅಥವಾ ತೀವ್ರ ಲಾರಿಂಜೈಟಿಸ್ ರೀತಿಯ ಇತರೆ ಕಾರಣಗಳಿಂದಾಗಿ, ಸಂಭವಿಸುವುದನ್ನು ಹೊರತುಪಡಿಸಿ., ರೋಗಿಯ ದೇಹವು ಕೆಂಪುಗಟ್ಟುಲು ಪ್ರಾರಂಭವಾಗುವಾಗ , ತಕ್ಷಣ ಮೂಗಿನ ತುದಿಯನ್ನು ಒಂದು ಸೂಜಿಯಿಂದ ಚುಚ್ಚಿ ಎರಡು ಹನಿ ಕಪ್ಪು ರಕ್ತವನ್ನು ಹಿಂಡಿ ಹೊರತೆಗೆಯಿರಿ.

ಮೇಲೆ ನೀಡಿರುವ ಮೂರು ಕ್ರಮಗಳು ಖಂಡಿತವಾಗಿಯೂ ಯಾವುದೇ ರೀತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಅಪಾಯಕಾರಿಯಲ್ಲ, ಹಾಗೂ 10 ಸೆಕೆಂದುಗಳೊಳಗೆ ಕೈಗೊಳ್ಳಬಹುದು. ಒಂದು ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಕೆಲಸ ಮಾಡಿ ಹಾಗು ಇದನ್ನು ಸ್ನೇಹಿತರೊಂದಿಗೆ ಹಂಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳಿ! ನಾನು ಮಾಡಿದ್ದನೇ! ಕೇವಲ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ನೀಡುವುದಲ್ಲ , ಇದು ಜೀವವನ್ನು ಸಹ ಉಳಿಸಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ!

second one ripened using chemicals even the stem is yellow colour.

 So henceforth when you buy banana be careful. 👍🏻

07/03/20, 16:21 - Baava: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html
07/03/20, 16:23 - Baava: All of us have had coronovirus infection many times in our lives..covid 19 is a new strain with very high mortality it ratio and is a novel strain
08/03/20, 00:57 - Amshu: Very scary when you read this from the notification screen.😅
" _All of us have had Coronovirus_ .."

08/03/20, 10:22 - Anitha Athe: Thank you🙏
09/03/20, 13:49 - Baava: And No.. today's is not a market crash yet..it will be called a crash only when Nirmala aunty goes in front of the camera and   says India's economy is doing great😊
09/03/20, 14:04 - Puneeth: Blood bath for the markets. Is it recommended to stick on to small/mid cap MF SIPs at this stage?
09/03/20, 14:24 - Baava: From a long term perspective, yes..these will give much higher returns when markets recover
09/03/20, 14:24 - Baava: But markets will go further south before recovery
09/03/20, 14:24 - Puneeth: Yeah. Looks like it
09/03/20, 14:25 - Puneeth: 👍🏻
09/03/20, 14:25 - Baava: Markets look like early 2008 now..
09/03/20, 14:26 - Baava: And from long term I am assuming Modi and his ilk will not rule us forever😊

10/03/20, 12:50 - Dimpakka: While I appreciate the new corona virus advisory, it is irritating to hear it every time I make a call.  If you press # the message will stop and the call will go thru.
10/03/20, 12:50 - Dimpakka: This works☝🏻
10/03/20, 12:57 - Baava: Not only #, one can press any number
10/03/20, 13:02 - Surya: Doesn’t seem to work today

Was working till yesterday 😑

10/03/20, 13:09 - Sugama: Yeah worked😀
10/03/20, 13:09 - Baava: Somebody has fwded the # message to Govt!
10/03/20, 13:09 - Baava: And they stopped
10/03/20, 13:10 - Baava: Pls don't fwd the 1 message!
10/03/20, 13:10 - Sugama: 🤣🤣
10/03/20, 13:19 - Sinchana: Even 1 didn’t work for me
10/03/20, 13:21 - Puneeth: Since afternoon # is working for me.
10/03/20, 13:24 - Puneeth: Well the funny side of this is, now people on WhatsApp have stopped worrying about how to stop Coronavirus and focusing on how to stop Coronavirus advisory before calls. 
If you can’t convince them, confuse them!

12/03/20, 16:50 - Kampa Aunt: For the first time in India women can now know all their legal rights at the click of a button. India's first website for women's laws, called *Pink Legal*, has been launched by a female lawyer from Hyderabad. 

Pink Legal explains all women related rights, from sexual harassment, rape, how to file a police complaint, to cyber bullying, property rights, etc. in a very easy to understand manner. 

 It is something that ALL women in India need, as we all need to know our legal rights.

You must go check out this website right now! http://pinklegal.in/

16/03/20, 10:29 - Kampa Aunt: Italy reported its first two cases on 30 Jan. 
Total of ONLY 4 cases on 21 Feb. 
Total of 20 cases, on 22 Feb, the next day. 
23 Feb (79), 
24 Feb (>150),
25 Feb (322), 
26 Feb (400), 
27 Feb (655), 
28 Feb (888), 
01 Mar (1577), 
02 Mar (1835), 
03 Mar (2263), 
05 Mar (3858), 
06 Mar (4636), 
08 Mar (7375 - 366 deaths - Clampdown of northern Italy 16 million people), 
09 Mar (9172 - 463 deaths - Countrywide lockdown)
10 Mar (10149 - 631 deaths)
11 Mar (12462 - 827 deaths)
13 Mar (15000 -1400 deaths)
Look at this. From just 4 cases 25 days back..... 

*One of the main reasons is said to be the delay in enforcing restrictions in Italy. After China, Now it is fully blown up epidemic in Italy & it is moving to other  European countries as declared by WHO. This is third stage in Italy & Europe & second stage in USA.*
*In India, we are passing through 1st stage and 2nd stage is very near. China has shown the way to the world. This epidemic is controlled by precautions as there is no medicine available. Next 30 days are very crucial. We must follow the precautions & remain home as much as possible. We can defeat the virus by taking precautions suggested by WHO & remaining at home.*

Take this seriously. 
Avoid all unnecessary social contacts.
16/03/20, 10:30 - Kampa Aunt: *Sharing a list of surface contact points in daily life, where either multiple or unknown people contact. The Virus is spreading from surfaces mainly, and reportedly lives at least 9 hours outside the host:*

1.  Morning milk bags. 
2. Elevator buttons. 
3. Door bells. 
4. Newspapers.
5. Car door after wash.
6. Garbage can exchange with housekeeping staff (also their ingress into housing society, and movement from house to house).
7. Raw vegetable and fruits purchased. 
8. Shop counters. 
9. Office pantry, lunchroom, washroom, and door handles.
10. Garden seats. 
11. Play area swings, etc. (though for an unknown reason, young children thankfully are less affected)
12. Maids touching multiple surfaces at home.
13. All door knobs.
14. Packets of Delivery boys - Amazon, Swiggy, etc.
15. Any shopping packets.
16. Currency notes and coins. 
17. Uber, Auto, etc. 
18. Bus and train handles
19. Shoes, etc., which may step on spit.
20. If travelling by air, then multiple points from departing terminal to arrival terminal.

India has likely hit the exponential upward part of the contagion, and the precautions in the  next 2- 4 weeks are very important.
16/03/20, 14:14 - Geethathe: They drive us mad with Corona...

We have become crazy.

I went to the bathroom at a restaurant. I washed my hands, opened the door with my elbow, I raised the toilet seat with my foot, I switched on the water faucet with a tissue then opened the bathroom door  to leave with my elbow and when i returned to my table I realized.... I forgot to pull up my pants!!!

16/03/20, 15:51 - Baava: In short : 2 drugs to be avoided: 

Ibuprofen and ACE inhibitors. 
So if anybody out of you/ your relatives are on ACE inhibitors for treatment of HT, urgently switch to Calcium channel blockers. 
Logic: SARS-Cov 2 ie COVID 19 acts through ACE2. Ibuprofen and Sartans both upregulate the ACE2 Receptors, thus help the virus to amplify.

16/03/20, 20:53 - Baava: Yes
16/03/20, 20:53 - Baava: But as testing is done only for few folks the data is misleading
16/03/20, 20:54 - Baava: We likely have millions already infected with mild symptoms who will recover without medication
16/03/20, 20:55 - Baava: As 80% of the infected don't show any symptoms, only s random sampled tests will give the correct picture...

20/03/20, 12:35 - Sugama: (𝑺𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒐𝒏𝒆'𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒔 𝒔𝒐 𝒃𝒆𝒂𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒇𝒖𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒂𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒖𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒅)

Since we are reading enough grim news about the virus, on a lighter note here are some good side-effects of the virus outbreak as well.....

𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙨: We always believed exams are so important for children, we could not do education without this primitive humiliating ritual on children. Today we have seen it is possible to do away with it completely. Children got promoted to the next class without any stress of an exam...nothing bad happened!

𝑾𝒐𝒓𝒌 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒉𝒐𝒎𝒆: Work from home is an ideal solution for the traffic and pollution problems in a city like Bangalore, but we still believed (mostly the company insisted that) it was important to drive our car, burn fuel, waste a lot of productive time and go to an office to work, every single day. But when the Virus came we figured it is possible to work from home and still get work done.

𝒆𝑴𝒆𝒆𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒔: Clients who always insisted on face to face meetings just discovered it is possible to have face to face meetings over Skype. It saves travel, time, biscuits, water, water bottles, coffee, tea, air-conditioning....so on.

𝑴𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒔: We thought malls are the best place to unwind. Shopping, cinema, food, etc. There was a FOMO if you don't rush to PVR and catch that stupid film on the first day. Today we found our home is best place to unwind. Especially when our children are around and they have no homework to do.

𝑾𝒆𝒅𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒔: We believed weddings should be grand, an opportunity to show off our social standing and wealth. Today we know it is possible to invite just 15 people and hold the event with simplicity and dignity.

𝑭𝒖𝒏𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒔: Funerals are now simple private moments for the close grieving family and close friends.

𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒚𝒆𝒓𝒔: We have learned to talk to God without actually going to a temple, church or mosque.

𝑩𝒊𝒓𝒕𝒉𝒅𝒂𝒚 𝒑𝒂𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒆𝒔: OMG! We never thought our children can age without them. Today birthdays are quiet and meaningful family only events, where we celebrate the fact that our children are alive and healthy. Isn't that what birthdays are all about, unlike a competitive sport among parents as it has become?

Traffic is less, city is quiet, families are together, home cooking is back, children are happy, spouses are talking again...it is love in the time of Corona.

20/03/20, 12:43 - Dimpakka: 👍🏻😊
20/03/20, 17:17 - Baava: Nice one
20/03/20, 17:18 - Baava: Though if the situation continues like this there won't be any work to do WFH!
20/03/20, 17:19 - Baava: Brace for MASSIVE  spending cuts by clients and enterprises.. hopefully things will get better sooner than later..
20/03/20, 17:22 - Arpith: Righttttt... Wait for some more time.. This is sooo not true..
20/03/20, 17:27 - Baava: Also note that malls, parties, weddings are a source of significant employment opportunity for many folks
20/03/20, 17:30 - Dimpakka: Agreed, but just a positive outlook to current situation😊
20/03/20, 17:31 - Baava: As long as it not Covid19 Positive😊
20/03/20, 17:32 - Baava: And from a personal perspective, Apoorva and I have interacted for a significantly lesser time WFH than when we used to go to office!
20/03/20, 17:34 - Dimpakka: So true
20/03/20, 19:06 - Puneeth: Yeah I totally agree it’s not good for the economy, and we definitely need to brace ourselves for tougher times. And I’m sure this situation might not make a complete change to what we were or where we were headed to.  But I personally feel this sudden stop was like a detox session that was required at a global level, it did change our perspectives in many ways. For example in our Org we give 1 day a week work from home, and many a times noticed people seeing that as a rest day with low productivity. And other teams and companies fighting to get work from home as management thought it would be low productivity as well. Now that people have got used to this routine they are actually working more, their energies are more (considering how traffic can drain you out in Bangalore, 2-3 hrs on the road) and employees have started taking more ownership. So here is a new perspective to the traffic challenges and how companies thought we just could not run teams at home. In just 1 week of declaring WFH we’ve had every manager right from the CEO communicating on how to effectively WFH, how to keep the employees moral high and studying the psychological effects of working in isolation, and help boost it. Funny situation now is our teams are asking permission to work from office and we are restricting them. Basically we think we just cannot achieve something, but circumstances make us do it more efficiently than we were doing before. Effectively at the end of the day, our energies are still high. It’s been a long day and since the Last one and a half hour I’ve been in an escalation, and yet writing this looooooong message as I still have that energy left unlike another day, while eating jackfruits the min I shut my laptop 😃

20/03/20, 20:55 - Mummy: ಕೊರೋನ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಇಟಲಿ ಪ್ರಜೆಯ ಪತ್ರ. 
ಕನ್ನಡಕ್ಕೆ ನೌಫಲ್ ಸಾಲ್ಮರ

ಇಟಲಿ ಪ್ರಜೆಯ ಪತ್ರ,

ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಶಾಂತಿ ...

ನಾವು ಇಟಲಿಯ ಮಿಲನ್ ಎಂಬ ನಗರ‌ದಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಸಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇವೆ. 

ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಕಷ್ಟದ ದಿನಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಜೀವನ(How is life here in Milan During These Difficult Days)ಹೇಗಿದೆ ಎಂದು ನಾನು ನಿಮಗೆ ಹೇಳುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ನಮ್ಮ ತಪ್ಪುಗಳಿಂದ ನೀವು ಕಲಿಯಬೇಕು ಎಂದು ನಾನು ಭಾವಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ.
ನಾವು ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿದ್ದೇವೆ, ಬೀದಿಗಿಳಿಯಲು  ನಮಗೆ ಅನುಮತಿ ಇಲ್ಲ, ಯಾರಾದರೂ ಮನೆಯಿಂದ ಹೊರಗೆ ಹೋದರೆ ಅವರನ್ನು ಪೊಲೀಸರು ಬಂಧಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ವ್ಯಾಪಾರಗಳು, ಮಾಲ್‌ಗಳು, ಇತ್ಯಾದಿಗಳನ್ನು ಮುಚ್ಚಲಾಗಿದೆ, ಬೀದಿಗಳು ನಿರ್ಜನವಾಗಿದೆ.

ಇದು ಪ್ರಪಂಚದ ಅಂತ್ಯ ಎಂಬ  ಭಾವನೆಯಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ.

ಜೀವಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ದೇಶವಾದ  ಇಟಲಿ ಕೆಲವೇ ಸೆಕೆಂಡುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕರಾಳ ದೇಶದಂತೆ ಮಾರ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ.
ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಜನರು ದುಃಖ, ಆತಂಕ ಮತ್ತು ಗೊಂದಲಕ್ಕೊಳಗಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಈ ದುಃಸ್ವಪ್ನವು ಯಾವಾಗ ಕೊನೆಗೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂದು ನಮಗೆ ತಿಳಿದಿಲ್ಲ.

ನಾವು ಮಾಡಿದ ತಪ್ಪು ಏನೆಂದರೆ, ಇಲ್ಲಿ ರೋಗ ಪ್ರಾರಂಭವಾದಾಗ ಜನರು ಅದನ್ನು ಗಂಭೀರವಾಗಿ ಪರಿಗಣಿಸಲಿಲ್ಲ, ಅವರು ಎಂದಿನಂತೆ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋದರು, ಅವರು ನಗರಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಮನರಂಜನಾ ಸ್ಥಳಗಳಿಗೆ ಪ್ರಯಾಣಿಸಿದರು. ನಾವು ರಜಾದಿನದಂತೆ ಆಚರಿಸಿದೆವು.
ಎಲ್ಲರೂ ಅದೇ ತಪ್ಪನ್ನು ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.

ಅದಕ್ಕಾಗಿಯೇ ನಾನು ನಿಮಗೆ ಮನವಿ ಮಾಡುತ್ತೇನೆ. ನಿಮ್ಮ ಪ್ರೀತಿಪಾತ್ರರಿಗೆ, ಪೋಷಕರು, ಅಜ್ಜ ಅಜ್ಜಿಯರನ್ನು ರಕ್ಷಿಸಿ, ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಈ ಅನಾರೋಗ್ಯವು ಅವರಿಗೆ ಅಪಾಯವನ್ನುಂಟು ಮಾಡುತ್ತದೆ.
ಪ್ರತಿದಿನ ಸುಮಾರು 200 ಜನರು ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ.  ಉತ್ತಮ ಔಷಧವಿಲ್ಲದ ಕಾರಣ ಅಲ್ಲ(ಮಿಲನ್‌ನಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಆಸ್ಪತ್ರೆ ವಿಶ್ವದ ಉತ್ತಮ ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಕೇಂದ್ರವಾಗಿದೆ) ಆದರೆ ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಸ್ಥಳವಿಲ್ಲ, ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ವೈದ್ಯರು ಅವರನ್ನು ಸಾವಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ತಲುಪಿಸಬಹುದು ...

ಅದನ್ನು ಮೊದಲು ನೋಡಿದ್ದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ನಾವು ಬೆಲೆ ತೆರುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ನಾವು ಮಾಡಿದ ತಪ್ಪನ್ನು ನೀವು ಮಾಡಬೇಡಿ. ನಾವು ಮಾಡಿದ ಮೂರ್ಖತನವನ್ನು ನೀವು ಪುನರಾವರ್ತಿಸಬೇಡಿ.

ನಾವು ಹೇಳುವುದನ್ನು ನೀವು ಆಲಿಸಿ(ಪಾಲಿಸಿ).

ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಜನದಟ್ಟಣೆ ಇರುವ ಸ್ಥಳಗಳಿಗೆ ಹೋಗಬೇಡಿ. ಹೊರಗೆ ಅಂದರೆ ಸಾರ್ವಜನಿಕ ಸ್ಥಳಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತಿನ್ನುವುದನ್ನು ತಪ್ಪಿಸಿ, ಮನೆಯೊಳಗೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗಿ ಇರಿ, ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ನಿರ್ದೇಶನಗಳನ್ನು ಅನುಸರಿಸಿ, ಜನರಿಂದ ಒಂದು ಮೀಟರ್ ದೂರವಿದ್ದು ಮಾತನಾಡಿ, ಹತ್ತಿರ ಹೋಗಬೇಡಿ, ಮುದ್ದಾಡಬೇಡಿ.
ನಿಮ್ಮ ರೋಗ ನಿರೋಧಕ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸಲು ವಿಟಮಿನ್ ಸಿ ಸೇವಿಸಿ.
ಈ ಸಾಂಕ್ರಾಮಿಕ ರೋಗ ಹರಡುವುದನ್ನು ತಡೆಯಲು ಅಧಿಕಾರಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡಿ.

ನಮ್ಮ ಪುಟ್ಟ ಇಟಲಿ ದೇಶವು ಅದರ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಗೆ ಹೋಗಬಹುದು.
ಇಟಲಿ ಇಂದು ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಪ್ರತ್ಯೇಕವಾಗಿರುವ ದೇಶವಾಗಿದೆ. ಆರು ಕೋಟಿಗೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಜನರು ಮನೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಸೀಮಿತರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ (ಸಂಪರ್ಕತಡೆಯನ್ನು).

ನಾವು ಆರಂಭದಲ್ಲೇ ಮುನ್ನೆಚ್ಚರಿಕೆಯ ಸೂಚನೆಗಳನ್ನು ಅನುಸರಿಸಿದ್ದರೆ ಇದನ್ನು ತಡೆಯಬಹುದಿತ್ತು & ನಾವು ಈ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿಗೆ ಈ ರೀತಿ ಆಗುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ.

ನೀವು ಮತ್ತು ನಿಮ್ಮ ಪ್ರೀತಿಪಾತ್ರರು ಸುರಕ್ಷಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದೀರಿ ಎಂದು ಖಚಿತಪಡಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಿ

ಈ ಪೋಸ್ಟ್ ಅನ್ನು ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಹಂಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳಿ. 

A letter from Italy,

 peace for all,
 We live in Italy - Milan,
 I'm going to share with you and explain to you, "How is life here in Milan" during these difficult days and how do I think you should learn from the mistakes and their consequences that we live here.
 We are currently in quarantine.  We don't take to the streets, the police are in constant motion and arrest anyone outside his home.
 Everything is closed!  ... business, malls, stores, all streets without movement.
 Feeling of the end of the world !!
 Italy, the country of living life, is transformed from one moment to the next as if it were a dark country of war.
 It is a fact that I never thought I would ever live!
 People are confused, sad, anxious and helpless, and often do not understand how this reality was imposed on them and when this whole nightmare will end.
 The big mistake was that at the start of the first hit people continued to lead their lives as usual and took to the streets for work, entertainment and feeling like a vacation period, so gatherings with friends and banquets abound.
 Everyone was wrong and so were you!
 I beg you, be careful, this is neither a laugh nor a joke.
 Protect your loved ones, your parents, and your grandparents!  The disease is dangerous for them.
 About 200 people die here every day, not because medicine in Milan is not good (it's one of the best in the world), but rather because there are no places for everyone!
 Doctors choose who will die!  This is only because of the silliness of the citizens at the beginning, who decided to continue their lives as usual, regardless of the new situation!
 Please, learn from the mistakes, we are a small country that could end up with a great tragedy.
 Listen well now ,,, 🙏
 Don't go out into crowded places.
 Try not to eat in public places.
  Stay longer at home during this time!
 Listen to the Ministry of Health guidelines (don't play it!).
  Talk about a meter away from each person, do not come close, do not cuddle or accept.
 Get a complementary and preventive treatment and learn from others' mistakes.
 We recommend that you take vitamin C to boost your immune system.

 Helping professionals prevent the spread of the epidemic ...

  In Italy, the entire country is isolated, meaning 60 million people in quarantine !!
 This would have been prevented if people had heard the instructions from the beginning.
 Take care of yourself and the life of the one you love ❤❤

21/03/20, 15:19 - Geethathe: This video is scary but true. RML hospital’s head of chest Deptt is openly saying  that india would be worse than Italy and Spain and may be even China..as per him just wait for next week and see how it explodes. Today alone we have got 50 new cases. He says still we haven’t started testing people and numbers are heavily underreported...as per him two weeks of strict curfew is needed and only very few services should run else 100% lockdown.
21/03/20, 15:19 - Geethathe: <Media omitted>
21/03/20, 17:47 - Baava: Yes.. statistical models show we likely have millions already infected with most not showing symptoms...as we don't do random testing we will never know the real situation unless deaths start showing up..(which is 15-20 days post infection)..let's take this very seriously..total self Quarantine for next few weeks is the approach..also ensure your domestic helps also are supported ( we have ours 2 weeks off for now with pay).. especially ensure those who are more than 60 yrs old don't come in contact with even extended family members
21/03/20, 18:15 - Geethathe: *Important update*
Please wear a mask at home also, specially when alone...

*This may or may not prevent Corona but will surely stop you from eating more*

26/03/20, 13:33 - Kampa Aunt: RULES FOLLOWED BY SOUTH KOREA TO CONTROL COVID-19

Currently lockdown in entire India. *But you need to go out for daily essentials.*
 Follow these *ONEs.*

*ONE IN ONE FORMULA* 

*ONE PERSON ONE WEEK ONE NEED, SAVE ALL INDIA* 

*ONE person*: Identify one adult in a family for going out. Only he or she will go out. NOBODY ELSE.

*ONE dress:* Use only one dress and same dress every time you go out. Use full length dress. Don't mix this dress with your other dresses. 

*ONE wallet*: Use only one wallet. Don't mix these currency, coins and cards with other which already are there at home.

*ONE shopping bag:* Use only one and same shopping bag every time. 

*ONE vehicle:* Use same vehicle and key. Avoid public transportation.

*ONE go:* Avoid going out multiple times. Finish all your work in one go.

Avoid taking mobile phone or restrict using it.

*Avoid crowding and come back immediately once you finish your work.*

Use your non dominant hand or elbow to open the door or push the buttons. 

*Once you come back:* Keep your dress, wallet, bags, keys in a separate bag. Don't mix with others. Do thorough hand wash and face wash before touching anything and anyone. Clean your mobile phone surface with sanitizer. Best is to avoid mobile phone. 

*India is a good producer of pulses, which can replace vegetables, to avoid going to vegetables market*


*Remember, we CAN'T AVOID exposure but CAN REDUCE exposure.*

28/03/20, 10:15 - Krishna uncle: RECOMMENDATION from *Psychologists*. 

*1* Isolate yourself from news about the virus. (Everything we need to know, we already know).

*2*. Don't look for additional information on the Internet, it would weaken your mental state. 

*3.* Avoid sending fatalistic messages. Some people don't have the same mental strength as you (Instead of helping, you could activate pathologies such as depression).

*4.* If possible, listen to music at home at a pleasant volume. Look for board games to entertain children, tell stories and future plans. 

*5.* Maintain discipline at home by washing your hands, putting up a sign or alarm for everyone in the house.

*6* Your positive mood will help protect your immune system, while negative thoughts have been shown to depress your immune system and make it weak against viruses.

*7.* Most importantly, firmly believe that this will pass and that the universe is in the hands of God. He is a God of love and not of punishment.              Good morning have great weekend ahed can v avoid negative messages ? V believe in thought power . Let’s send positive thoughts .

In table also 9 table is special, 9 x 1 to 9 x 9  all multiplication  result and adding the arrived   each total  is also 9 . eg. 9 x 2=18 and 1+8 =9, 
April-4+ Date is 5th=9
HINDUSTAN = 9
Time  on Sunday -9pm
Duration of lighting-9 minutes,
Balance lock down days left as on Sunday will be

"Got up early and to make my wife Happy.. I kept the vessel with milk for boiling but the milk never boiled, then realized that it was not milk but idli batter.

My God, to dispose off the burnt idli batter without the knowledge of the wife was worse than a murderer disposing the dead body." 😟

20/04/20, 14:47 - Krishna uncle: My association with Nanjundaiah thatha was just 5 or 6 years. But yet, I could find in him a simple and chaste personality. He had a clear definition for his life and living. I could have learnt a lot more from him. His memory is still green in all of us because, he stood unique and a great example of integrity and independence. Certainly a combination of a spiritualism and practicality. 
Miss you Thatha.
May your soul rest in peace......

25/04/20, 15:41 - Arpith: Send me bird's eye view pic
25/04/20, 16:05 - Baava: investment advise: If you have debt mutual funds which have invested in non-Govt funds, pls redeem them...many debt funds will go under water..If they are liquid funds or funds who have invested in Govt bonds its ok..but all other debt funds will be very risk as companies dont have revenues to service debts..NAV values of these funds dont mean much as they are not marked to market
25/04/20, 16:07 - Baava: to check where your debt funds have invested:  got https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutualfundindia/  check your funds and the portfolio of your fund..if it is corporate debt, try to redeem it.. if you any questions, you can send the debt fund name and i can check
25/04/20, 16:58 - Puneeth: Beautiful flower collection 👌🏻

29/04/20, 11:34 - Puneeth: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zoom-selects-oracle-as-a-cloud-infrastructure-provider-for-its-core-online-meeting-service-301048076.html
29/04/20, 11:34 - Puneeth: Zoom is now on Oracle cloud infrastructure
29/04/20, 11:35 - Baava: Great..
29/04/20, 11:35 - Baava: can we get a few free acoounts ? 🙂
29/04/20, 11:38 - Puneeth: Yeah. Now that it’s on Oracle, it says somewhere that now if you’re registered as a school/institution the 40 mins limit will not be applicable. It’s like free. But without the advanced features
29/04/20, 11:38 - Baava: ok..this will help in online teaching
29/04/20, 11:39 - Puneeth: <Media omitted>
29/04/20, 11:41 - Puneeth: But for family video chatting, they know we talk a lot. So still capping at 40 mins 😬
29/04/20, 11:48 - Baava: yeah,,,they must have audited our calls
29/04/20, 12:06 - Manumama: What does that mean ? Does it become free of cyber crime ??
29/04/20, 12:07 - Manumama: Is it a new version or the older one
29/04/20, 12:07 - Baava: they will be using Oracle cloud infra for hosting
29/04/20, 12:08 - Baava: i guess security concerns will still remain as hosting is just one part of the end-to-end n/w
29/04/20, 12:10 - Puneeth: Application is the same. But it will be sitting on Oracle cloud infra/servers. Which are not based in China. And OCI (Oracle Cloud Infra) is a generation 2 infra which is much more secure.
29/04/20, 12:10 - Puneeth: But if there are loop holes in the application nothing that OCI can help
29/04/20, 12:11 - Puneeth: It is very important I follow the zoom guidelines to secure calls
29/04/20, 12:12 - Puneeth: Like Ensure you have a strong password for people to join. Ensure as a host you keep control to accept who can join. Do not allow people to chance their login names during a session. Etc.
29/04/20, 12:12 - Baava: there will be multiple layers - authentication at end points, routers, switches, firewalls, cloud (where app is hosted)
29/04/20, 12:13 - Baava: even if cloud is secure,  if they want to do something deliberately (which is the allegation now), they can very well do that
29/04/20, 12:14 - Puneeth: The most vulnerable at this time is the application security measures, which the host needs to ensure is taken care of
29/04/20, 12:14 - Baava: yes...but there have been news of login credentials being stolen
29/04/20, 12:15 - Puneeth: Zoom is the official video conferencing app for Oracle. There are multiple measures and encryption within Oracle to ensure it is safe. So this needs to be taken up by IT admin team.
29/04/20, 12:15 - Baava: but in any case nothing is 100% foolproof..as u say we also need to do our bit at our end
29/04/20, 12:16 - Baava: using via enterprise is always safer...we may even ask for specific hosting terms....
29/04/20, 12:16 - Puneeth: These measures were enforced for us to take up, and once we put all the settings as per the OT guidelines those features got locked. We can’t revert back. One of the measures Oracle took to secure our calls
29/04/20, 12:17 - Baava: ok
29/04/20, 12:22 - Puneeth: Yes. That’s true
29/04/20, 12:25 - Puneeth: Also. There have been cases where users have received emails saying their meeting is started and to click on the link to join, or to cancel a meeting clink on a link. Users should always avoid clicking on such links which is part of a cyber crime trap

01/05/20, 21:07 - Krishna uncle: Ramayana and Mahabharata are the two great epics India, that no country in the world has ever created. These are the only two epics which are known to the whole population of the country. No other epic in the world has those credentials.

04/05/20, 10:54 - Baava: A highly motivational message:

My salary has not increased 
for 11 years. 
And This year no salary due to corona crisis.
Performed the marriages of my son and daughter just last year. 
Now I understand my daughter in law and daughter both are pregnant. 
Marriage of second son is on cards. 
I lost my father long back .
I have a bankrupt brother and my mother - a widow who is not medically keeping well is also to be taken care of. 

Guys  - despite all these problems, if I am always positive and smiling why can't you? 

It’s all state of Mind ...... Be positive even if u have nothing ..

Sincerely yours,
Mukesh Ambani.

04/05/20, 12:18 - Dimpakka: Identify the animal....
Open the pic full screen, Place this pic at the tip of ur nose , then focus on the pic n move it slowly away from ur nose.
It is amazing !  There is a 3D  animal .It is amazing if you can see it ...
Let's see whose eyes have not developed presbyopia...
You may not get it at the first try...
My advice: do NOT Imagine any animal and try... Like just because it's a yellow and green in color, don't expect anything. Experience the first ever 3D pic in ur mobile.

11/05/20, 17:12 - Baava: The job market of the future:
*Next round of resumes will have such highlights:*

- Having a home with (soundproof) workstation or seperate study room
- Full time house-help 
- 2 broadband connections, mobile network booster
- can talk in the same tone even if woken up by call. 
- can initiate, organize and come live on an online meeting in just 12-15 seconds.

*Future interviews be like:*

- Your kid is crying, your maid hasn't come and you have to host a zoom call: tell us your priorities!
- You have 10mbps data speed, your wife has a meeting to attend, your mother in law is watching Netflix, and your kid has an online class. Your team is complaining that your voice is breaking on Video conference, what will you do? 
- Trick question: yaar mujhe to khana khane ke baad bahut achhi need aati hai... tumko aati hai ki nahi? 

*Future employee demands be like:*

- sir aapki company maid back-up bhejti hai ki nahi?
- HR ke paas children ke liye special training module hai ki nahi?

*Future employee onboarding kits be like:*

- Broadband connection kit
- Home workstation
- 100 back up maid hours by bookmybai 
- 1000 credits of Urban clap
- Tenure time Byju's subscription for kids

15/05/20, 19:13 - Baava: Practically no new testing is happening since 3 weeks.. likely 100s of asymptomatic cases not getting diagnosed..
15/05/20, 19:15 - Arpith: Ya..see that.. Very less testing has happened...but if testing has stopped.. Idk what to say..
15/05/20, 19:16 - Baava: Sadly most ppl now think there is no threat of virus. If anything this is the most crucial period...unless we do large scale testing we will not know the extent of the problem as most cases are asymptomatic and they might spread it to vulnerable ppl
15/05/20, 19:18 - Baava: It almost seems like a normal January day if we see the main roads today in Mys. Most ppl are venturing out without masks, crowding is common place

21/05/20, 08:58 - Baava: basically both our direct taxes (income tax) and indirect tax (GST) is not coming back to us..we are subsidizing the cowbelt..and we are now borrowing...
21/05/20, 09:02 - Baava: after GST implementation, the only real way state government can raise money for itself is via liquor tax..every other tax is collected by GoI and distributed to states and we get less than 60% of what we send to center....so when UP state govt budget talks abt building cowsheds, its our tax money as they get 70% more money from center than what they contribute

23/05/20, 19:29 - Geethathe: This is by far the best joke I read in a while.... 😂😂😂

defence secretary in a briefing to Trump: "Sir, there has been a major terrorist attack in Chennai, India. 36 Tamillians have been killed"

Trump is silent. His lips quiver. His hands shiver. His eyes wells up. He is unable to speak.

Defence secretary is stunned. He never imagined that this event could affect him so badly.

After a few minutes, in a trembling voice, Trump asks "So, how many millions are there in one tamillion?"

😜🤣🤣🤣🤣

..and we are a long way from peak...
31/05/20, 17:21 - Baava: India is testing just about 2500 ppl per million population. US is testing 50,000/million..so our 1.8 Lacs +ve cases is highly misleading ..if we test like US, we  likely have  at least 35-40 Lacs +ve cases already ..Even the  US number of 50,000/million is on lower side.  Russia has tested 70K/million and Spain has tested 76K/million...we are still a long way from the peak...Govt is opening up lockdown for economic reasons and not due to health reasons..Pls be mindful when we go out and interact with others. Most undiagnosed +ve cases will not have symptoms but they can infect others....wear mask , protect the elders at home and those with compromised immunity (diabetes, BP, cardiovascular  etc). Better to see them alive a few months later than dead in a few weeks.

07/06/20, 10:28 - Manumama: A letter to my elder sister ..

Dear Sujatakka 
    It’s your 60th birthday .....you spent 60 years !!!!... wow time pass by ..
There were thoughts going on in my( our) mind about your legacy ...
You are the eldest in our family and all 3 of us  looked upto you when we were kids( hope Kampa and Madhu Anna agrees) . You led the way ... you were strong ... you were bold ,,,fearless ... 
and because of your bold attitude ... we all (3 of us) developed strong will power and each one of us are strong , confident and more than any thing all 4 of us are “ workaholics “. We are unique in a way that we have perseverance in what ever we do especially the commitment we have ( of course in a different field). 
Each one of us be it Madhu Anna or Kampa or me  and you ... we are strong headed hard to crack kind of characters and none can divide us (60 years of testing time ). 
We all today what we are ... is just because of “you “ and just that “you led the way”. 
As a kid I still remember that you were a force to reckon with ( your aggression, passion and thinking capability). You were the most “ confident women” I have known . In fact you were the leader for NP family also ( amongst the grand children). 
   I know every one goes through difficult phase of life ( probably all of us went through bit more ) but definitely you didn’t deserve so much hard life that gone throughout your life. More importantly we all shared it and will continue to share ... please count on us .!! 

   But remember you created 3 youngsters of great attitude with values and integrity( of course in that cause you did hit hard on our knuckes😄) . 
   You are the lady who fearlessly walked across the street at 3 am for a cause. You are one who opened up a family feeling ( when you got married). 
You always behaved like next door girl when any one wants help . You have great friends who love you . What more you can ask for 

You are our leader , a hero and please remain so . Do not change a bit . Do not give up your inborn  character !!

We love you 
Wish you all the best and many more decades to pass by ...
God bless

07/06/20, 10:50 - Puneeth: Wishing Am’amma a very happy 60th B’day. 🎊💐🎉
07/06/20, 10:50 - Puneeth: Very thoughtful message 👌🏻
07/06/20, 10:53 - Sugama: Very nice write up Manu maama! Every expression is just so true. We are proud of the four of you 😀

Madhu
07/06/20, 11:02 - Anitha Athe: 👍👍 wow ! Great  Sujatkka.
07/06/20, 11:08 - Sinchana: Wow Manu maama, never knew your hands which held needle, scissors and blade were equally skillful even with the pen.. 👍🏼🙏🏼
07/06/20, 11:10 - Krishna uncle: Oh my goodness! 
Never imagined Manu could write so well! In fact, Manu has given an effective expression to all that we think about Sujathakka. The whole text is worded so well and effective that we all should just say-  "Same here"

My deep appreciations to Manu  for this fantastic write up. I think this is the best presentation ever given to Sujathakka on her great day. Such a present came to her at a very appropriate time. ( I mean, when it is needed )

My Salutes to you Sujathakka for what all you have been to this family. Certainly we all feel you deserve much more happiness and comfort. My prayers to almighty to grant all that you deserve hereafter. 
Wish you a very happy Diamond Birthaday Sujathakka.
All our prayers for you today.
07/06/20, 11:14 - Sinchana: That’s true Ammamma, you have challenged your own capabilities and out performed every bit of it. May your strength continue beat all the odds and we continue to get inspired by you as always.. 🙏🏼
07/06/20, 11:16 - Krishna uncle: What you have written is also very 'touching' Madhu. A great reward to a great sister. 
It's my only wish "May this family bonding be strengthened more more more for ever'.

15/06/20, 16:58 - Baava: Key takeaway - "While talking of solutions, even at the cost of repetition, the first thing I would say is each one of us needs to make serious efforts to break the chain of transmission. If we have the same rate of spread, trust me, no infrastructure will be able to handle that load and we are heading for a serious situation. Let us pray that we do not reach that situation. I would repeat that please, all of us, let us have a self-imposed lockdown and minimise people-to-people interaction, so that we are able to break the cycle and not let those numbers come true."

27/06/20, 18:57 - Baava: Old age homes accounted to close to half of deaths in US. In Italy old folks died because they stayed with younger infected folks at home. In US, the old died as old age homes were not isolated. Once virus struck the facility, it spread rapidly amongst the vulnerable...
27/06/20, 20:53 - Baava: <Media omitted>
27/06/20, 21:17 - Puneeth: The next 2 - 3 months will be really tough. Gotta be very careful.
27/06/20, 21:35 - Baava: Yes..and this number is grossly undercounted.. Karnataka has tested 8500/million .US has tested 95000/ million and  sero tests say they have missed 10X cases since March..even a conservative extrapolation of this says Karnataka has 100X cases of what we have reported..so we likely have atleast 10L cases already( with mostly asymptomatic who have recovered or will recover without any treatment)..best way to deal with this is to assume everyone we come into contact with is +ve and limit outside contact to a bare minimum
27/06/20, 21:38 - Baava: Also we need to protect aged folks inside our houses..it's not enough they don't go out..50% of US dead(60,000 ppl) never even went out of their dwellings. Ppl coming to meet them or taking care of them infected them
27/06/20, 22:10 - Puneeth: But somehow the majority think they r immune to it, and it can only happen to some unknow person. And continue life like any other day.

29/06/20, 16:44 - Kampa Aunt: IT giants have started to vacate rented buildings at all major IT parks . They have planned to open "Supervising hubs" (controlling offices) in small buildings. 75 to 90% staff are going to work from own natives. 
Next major change being made silently by NASSCOM (with +2800 IT and related company members in india) have approached  Central /State Govts  to

 i) amend or abolish major ( 75%)portion of Labour laws to suit IT sector  "work from home" . Central Govt has given consent in the last week of May 2020 itself   and advised NASSCOM to give blue print of amendment in Labour laws

 ii) to amend Income tax Act to include expenses by Employer/Employee incurred at home, amendment to cover insurance for working from home.

So it is a matter of time before Acts/Laws are amended. So "Work from home" has come to stay. So no more necessity for IT people to stay at Metropolitan cities. Also the hiring has started by major IT companies but offers are being rolled out with wfh condition and lesser pay compared to before . So this year appraisal will see 0 hike, 0 variable and layoff of higher paid professionals. 

How will it impact salaried IT professionals ? 
Let's divide them in two categories . 
Category 1 : professionals with own home or home loan in major cities like pune, Delhi, Bangalore. 
Category 2: batchlors with few years of experience who lived in rented places 

Category 2 will relocate happily to their hometown and able to save more. Even companies will give less pay but still they will be able to create a balance between earnings and savings. 
Category 1 will face double impact of inflation in cities as already can be seen with jacked up prices of vegetables, and FMCG, Lower property rentals ( almost halved) and a small negligible reduction in existing home loan rates of around 2 percent. The properties will come for distress sales due to job loss or non availability of rents. Forget buying new house from builder , as market is already flooded with resale and distress sales. 

The best example one can see is that monster.com has introduced a category of "covid impacted" profiles and there are already 18 lak covid profiles resumes in their portal. So it means 18 lak IT professionals already lost their job and selected "covid impacted " option . 

What can one do to safeguard their future ? 
1. Try to keep your unnecessary expenses under control. 
2. Avoid loans. 
3. Save as much as u can by avoiding taxes . It's no more a desire to save but need of the hour to survive recession ..yes you heard it right .. recession for next 3-4 years .

Technology is the way forward .

*Zohnerism*

Why we need to *Avoid* watching too much of breaking news & panel discussions on Indian TV news channels now a  days! Specially local channels.

The notorious concept of  *Zohnerism*

 *Zohnerism* -  "the use of a  fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion". It’s all about twisting of simple facts to confuse people. 

In 1997, 14 year old Nathan Zohner presented his science fair project to his classmates, seeking to ban a highly toxic chemical from its everyday use.

The chemical in question? Dihydrogen monoxide.

Throughout his presentation, Zohner provided his audience scientifically correct evidence as to why this chemical should be banned.

He explained that dihydrogen monoxide:

Causes severe burns in while it’s in gaseous form
Corrodes and rusts metals
Kills countless amounts of people annually
Is commonly found in tumors, acid rain etc.
Causes excessive urination and bloating if consumed
Zohner also noted that the chemical is able to kill you if you depend on it and then experience an extended withdrawal.

He then asked his classmates if they actually wanted to ban dihydrogen monoxide.

And so 43 out of the 50 children present voted to ban this clearly toxic chemical.

However…this chemical isn’t typically considered toxic at all.

In fact, dihydrogen monoxide is simply an unconventional name for water.

Nathan Zohner’s experiment wasn’t a legitimate attempt to ban water, but instead an experiment to get a representation of “how gullible” people can really be.

Also, all of the points that Zohner used to convey his point were 100% factually correct; he just skewed all of the information in his favour by omitting certain facts.

In recognition of his experiment, journalist James K. Glassman coined the term "Zohnerism" to refer to "the use of a  fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion".

And this occurs a lot more often than you think, especially when politicians, conspiracy theorists, etc., use proven facts to persuade people into believing false claims.

The fact that people can mislead, and be misled so easily, is highly unsettling. 

Just think about it!

22/07/20, 09:42 - Baava: My views on the market: NIFTY has crossed 11K.. companies have started to report their Q1 earnings From Price/Earnings perspective NIFTY P/E is at 29!! This kind of P/E typically signifies a country whose GDP is growing (or will grow in the future) at 10%+. (note India's GDP will be -5% to -10% in FY21)   Personally i think markets are way above where they should be. I think we may be looking at a crash.. Those who have a 5-10 year view may not have to worry and may continue their SIPs..But if somebody is risk-averse, they might want to cash out their investments.  This is my personal view and i may be wrong.

24/07/20, 12:26 - Krishna uncle: *ನಾಗೇಶ್ ಹೆಗಡೆ ಬರಹ:*

*ಕೊರೊನಾ ಅಲ್ಲ, ಮಾಹಿತಿಮಾರಿಯ ರುದ್ರ ನರ್ತನ*
 
[ಝೋನರಿಸಂ ಎಂದರೇನು? ಮನೆಯ ಉಪಚಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾರೂ ಕೋವಿಡ್-19ರಿಂದ ಸಾಯುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಯಾಕೆ? ಜೀವಪೋಷಕ ವೈರಸ್ಸುಗಳು ಯಾವವು? ಕಾಝಿರಂಗಾದಲ್ಲಿ 116 ವನ್ಯಜೀವಿಗಳು ಸತ್ತವೆಂಬ ಲೆಕ್ಕ ಹೇಗೆ ಸಿಕ್ಕಿತು? ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗಳನ್ನೆತ್ತಿ ನಾಗೇಶ ಹೆಗಡೆ ಬರೆದ ಲೇಖನ ಇದು] 

‘ಝೋನರಿಸಂ’ ಎಂದರೇನು ಗೊತ್ತೆ? ಸತ್ಯವನ್ನೇ ಹೇಳಿ ದಾರಿತಪ್ಪಿಸುವುದು! 
1997ರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಮೆರಿಕದ ಹೈಸ್ಕೂಲ್ ಹುಡುಗನೊಬ್ಬ ಅಂದಿನ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ ಸ್ಪರ್ಧೆಗೆಂದು ಒಂದು ಉಪನ್ಯಾಸ ಕೊಟ್ಟ. DHMO ಎಂಬ ರಾಸಾಯನಿಕ ವಸ್ತು ಅದೆಷ್ಟು ಅಪಾಯಕಾರಿ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ವಿವರಿಸಿದ. ಈ ಕೆಮಿಕಲ್ ನಿಂದಾಗಿ ಅಮೆರಿಕದ ಸಾವಿರಾರು ಜನರು ಪ್ರತಿ ವರ್ಷವೂ ಸಾಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಆಸ್ಪತ್ರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾವಿನಂಚಿಗೆ ಬಂದವರ ಕ್ಯಾನ್ಸರ್ ಗಡ್ಡೆಯಲ್ಲೂ ಅದು ಪತ್ತೆಯಾಗಿದೆ; ಆಕಾಶದಿಂದ ಸುರಿಯುವ ಆಸಿಡ್ ಮಳೆಯಲ್ಲೂ ಅದು ಕಂಡುಬಂದಿದೆ ಎಂದ.
 
DHMO ಸೋಂಕಿದರೆ ಕಬ್ಬಿಣ ಮತ್ತಿತರ ಕೆಲವು ಲೋಹಗಳು ಸುಟ್ಟುಹೋಗುತ್ತವೆ. ನೀವು ಅದರ ಕಣಗಳನ್ನು ನಿಷ್ಕಾಳಜಿಯಿಂದ ಸೇವಿಸಿದರೆ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆ ಉಬ್ಬರಿಸಿ ಬೆವರು ಕಿತ್ತು ಬರುತ್ತದೆ, ಮೂತ್ರವಿಸರ್ಜನೆಗೆ ಓಡಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಅದು ನಿಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಸುಡಬಹುದು. ಅಷ್ಟೇಕೆ, ಅದರ ಹಬೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಶ್ವಾಸಕೋಶಕ್ಕೆ ತುಸು ದೊಡ್ಡ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಕ್ಕರೆ ಸಾವು ನಿಶ್ಚಿತ. ಚಟದಂತೆ ಅದನ್ನೇ ಅವಲಂಬಿಸಿದವರು, ಕೊನೆಕೊನೆಗೆ ಪೂರೈಕೆ ನಿಂತರೆ ಬದುಕುವುದೇ ಕಷ್ಟವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕೆರೆಯಲ್ಲೂ ಅದು ಕಂಡುಬಂದಿದೆ. ಸರೋವರ, ನದಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಅಷ್ಟೇ ಏಕೆ, ನಲ್ಲಿಯಲ್ಲೂ ಅದು ಪತ್ತೆಯಾಗಿದೆ…. 

ಅಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಬಗೆಯ ಸಾವುನೋವಿಗೆ ಕಾರಣವಾಗಬಲ್ಲ ಆ DHMO ರಸಾಯನ ಸಂಯುಕ್ತದ ಪೂರ್ಣ ಹೆಸರು dihydrogen monoxide. 

ಆತ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದೆಲ್ಲವೂ ವೈಜ್ಞಾನಿಕ ಸತ್ಯವೇ ಆಗಿತ್ತು. ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವುದೂ ಉತ್ಪ್ರೇಕ್ಷೆ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ.  Nathan Zohner ನಾಥಾನ್ ಝೋನರ್ ಎಂಬ ಹೆಸರಿನ ಆ ಹುಡುಗ ತನ್ನ ಉಪನ್ಯಾಸವನ್ನು 50 ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳ ಕ್ಲಾಸಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಮಂಡಿಸಿ, ಕೊನೆಗೆ ಇಂಥ ಅಪಾಯಕಾರಿ ಕೆಮಿಕಲ್‌ಗೆ ನಿಷೇಧ ಹಾಕಬೇಕೊ ಬೇಡವೊ ಎಂದು ಪ್ರಶ್ನಿಸಿದ. 
43 ಮಕ್ಕಳು (86%) ‘ನಿಷೇಧಿಸಬೇಕು’ ಎಂದರು.
 
ತಮಾಷೆ ಏನೆಂದರೆ, ಆ ರಸಾಯನ ಸಂಯುಕ್ತಕ್ಕೆ H2O ಅಥವಾ ಸರಳ ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷ್ನಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಟರ್ ಎನ್ನುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಕನ್ನಡದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದು ನೀರು! ಎರಡು ಜಲಜನಕ ಮತ್ತು ಒಂದು ಆಮ್ಲಜನಕದ ಅಣುಗಳಿರುವ ಸಂಯುಕ್ತವಸ್ತು  ಅದು. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಅದನ್ನು ಡೈಹೈಡ್ರೊಜೆನ್‌ ಮೊನಾಕ್ಸೈಡ್‌ ಎಂತಲೂ ಕರೆಯಬಹುದು.

ಈಗ ಮತ್ತೊಮ್ಮೆ ಆ ಹುಡುಗ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದೆಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಓದಿ. ಅವೆಲ್ಲವೂ ಸತ್ಯ ತಾನೆ? 

ಈ ನೈಜ ಘಟನೆಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆ  Washington Post ಪತ್ರಿಕೆಗೆ ಜೇಮ್ಸ್ ಗ್ಲಾಸ್ಮನ್ ಎಂಬಾತ ಬರೆದ. ಸುತ್ತುಬಳಸಿದ ಸತ್ಯದ ಮಾತುಗಳಿಂದಲೇ ದಾರಿ ತಪ್ಪಿಸುವ ಅಥವಾ ತೀರ ಸುಲಭವಾಗಿ ಮೋಸಗೊಳಿಸುವ ಈ ತಂತ್ರಕ್ಕೆ ಆತ ‘ಝೋನರಿಸಂ’ ಎಂದು ಆ ಝೋನರ್ ಹುಡುಗನ ಹೆಸರನ್ನೇ ಇಟ್ಟ.

ಹಾಗೆ ನೋಡಿದರೆ, ಇದು ಝೋನರ್‌ನ ಒರಿಜಿನಲ್‌ ಕಾಪಿರೈಟ್  ಐಡಿಯಾ ಏನಲ್ಲ. 1983ರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಮೆರಿಕದ ಮಿಶಿಗನ್ ರಾಜ್ಯದ Durand Express   ಎಂಬ ವಾರಪತ್ರಿಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಇದು ಮೊದಲು ದಾಖಲಾಗಿತ್ತು.  DHMOದಿಂದಾಗುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಅಪಾಯಗಳನ್ನೂ ಪಟ್ಟಿಮಾಡಿತ್ತು. “…inhalation of this chemical “nearly always results in death,” ಎಂದು ಕೂಡ ಬರೆದಿತ್ತು. ಅದು ಏಪ್ರಿಲ್ 1ರ ಮೂರ್ಖರ ದಿನದಂದು ಪ್ರಕಟವಾಗಿದ್ದರಿಂದ ಜಾಣರು ಅದನ್ನೊಂದು ತಮಾಷೆ ಎಂಬಂತೆ ಓದಿಕೊಂಡರು.

ಯಾಕೊ, ಕೊರೊನಾ ಕುರಿತಂತೆ ದಿನನಿತ್ಯದ ‘ಭಯಾನಕ’ ವರದಿಗಳನ್ನು ಗ್ರಹಿಸುವಾಗಲೆಲ್ಲ ಝೋನರಿಸಂ ನೆನಪಿಗೆ ಬರುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಸತ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಲೇ ಯಾರೆಲ್ಲ ನಮ್ಮ ದಾರಿ ತಪ್ಪಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ! ವೈರಸ್ಸು, ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾ ಸದಾಕಾಲ ನಮ್ಮೊಂದಿಗೆ ಇವೆ. ಉಪಕಾರಿ ವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳು ತುಂಬ ಇವೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ಕಫ, ಸಿಂಬಳದಲ್ಲೇ ಅವಿತಿರುವ ವೈರಸ್ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತೆ?  ಅದು ನಮಗೆ ಅಪಾಯ ತರಬಲ್ಲ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳನ್ನು ಅಲ್ಲೇ ಹಿಡಿದು ನುಂಗಿಹಾಕುತ್ತಿರುತ್ತದೆ. ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಫೇಜಿಸ್ ಎನ್ನುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಅದರ ಅರ್ಥವೇ ‘ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾವನ್ನು ನುಂಗುವ’ ವೈರಸ್ ಅಂತ.
 
ಈಗ ಈ ನುಂಗುಬಾಕ ವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳನ್ನು (ಫೇಜಿಸ್‌ಗಳನ್ನು) ಅಷ್ಟಿಷ್ಟು ಬದಲಾಯಿಸಿ ಔಷಧವನ್ನಾಗಿ ಬಳಸಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಬೇರೆ ಗತಿ ಇಲ್ಲ! ಈಗೀಗ ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಆಂಟಿಬಯಾಟಿಕ್ ಔಷಧಗಳು ಯೂಸ್‌ಲೆಸ್ ಆಗುತ್ತಿವೆ; ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಅವನ್ನೇ ಜಾಸ್ತಿ ಬಳಸಿ ಬಳಸಿ, ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳೇ ಪ್ರತಿರೋಧ ಬೆಳೆಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಲಾಢ್ಯ ಆಗಿವೆ. ಅಂಥವುಗಳನ್ನು ಬಗ್ಗುಬಡಿಯಲು ಹೀಗೆ ಫೇಜಿಸ್‌ಗಳನ್ನು ದುಡಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ. 

ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳು ದಾಳಿ ಮಾಡುವುದು ಒಳ್ಳೆಯದೆಂದೇ ವೈದ್ಯವಿಜ್ಞಾನಿಗಳು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಅವು ಎಳೆಯರಲ್ಲಿ ರೋಗ ನಿರೋಧಕ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು (ರೋ.ಶ.) ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸುತ್ತವೆ. ಮತ್ತೆ ಕೆಲವು ವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳು ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಹದೊಳಗೆ ಸೇರಿದ, ರೋಗಕಾರಕ ವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳನ್ನು ಬಗ್ಗುಬಡಿಯುತ್ತವೆ.
 
ಪೆಗಿವೈರಸ್ ಎಂಬುದೊಂದಿದೆ. ಅದು ನಮ್ಮೊಳಗಿದ್ದರೂ ನಮಗೆ ಏನೂ ಅಪಾಯ ಉಂಟುಮಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೆ ಆ ವೈರಸ್ ಇದ್ದವರಿಗೆ ಏಡ್ಸ್ ರೋಗ ಬಂದಿದ್ದರೆ ಅವರು ದೀರ್ಘ ಕಾಲ ಬದುಕುತ್ತಾರೆ ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಗೊತ್ತಾಗಿದೆ. 
 
ರೋಗಕಾರಕ ವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತುಂಬ ಕ್ರೂರವಾದವೂ ಇವೆ. ಎಬೊಲಾ, ಝೀಕಾ ಅಂಥವು. ಆದರೆ ಕೊರೊನಾ ವೈರಸ್  ಅಷ್ಟೇನೂ ಭೀಕರ ಅಲ್ಲ. ಆರೋಗ್ಯವಂತ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಅದು ಜಾಸ್ತಿ ತೊಂದರೆ ಕೊಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಈಚೆಗೆ ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲೇ ನಡೆದ ಸಮೀಕ್ಷೆಯ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಶೇಕಡಾ 22ರಷ್ಟು ಜನರಿಗೆ ವೈರಸ್ ಬಂದು ಹೋಗಿದ್ದೇ ಗೊತ್ತಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೆ ಅವರ ರಕ್ತದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಡಿದಾಟದ ಕುರುಹುಗಳು  ಕಂಡುಬಂದಿವೆ.
 
ಅಂಥವರ ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊರೊನಾ ಥೇಟ್‌ ಬೆಕ್ಕಿನ ಮರಿಯಂತೆ ತೆಪ್ಪಗೆ ಕೂತಿರುತ್ತದೆ. ತನ್ನ ಸ್ವಭಾವವನ್ನೇ ಮರೆತು! 

ಕೊರೊನಾದ ಸ್ವಭಾವ ಏನು ಹೇಳಿ? ನಮ್ಮ ಗಂಟಲು-ಮೂಗಿನಲ್ಲಿ ತುರಿಕೆ ಉಂಟುಮಾಡಿ ‘ಆಕ್ಷೀ…’ ಎಂದು ಸೀನುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡುವುದು. ಆ ಮೂಲಕ ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಹದಿಂದ ತಾನೇ ಹನಿರೂಪದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಡಿದು ಆಚೆಗಿನ ಇನ್ನೊಬ್ಬರ ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗುವುದು. ಹಾಗೆ ಮಾಡುವ ಮೂಲಕ ಅದು ತನ್ನ ಪ್ರಸಾರ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯನ್ನು (ಟಿಆರ್ಪಿಯನ್ನು ಎನ್ನಿ!) ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ. 

ಗಟ್ಟಿ ಮನುಷ್ಯರಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಕ್ಕ ಕೊರೊನಾ ಆ ಗುಣವನ್ನೇ ಕಳೆದುಕೊಂಡು ತೆಪ್ಪಗೆ ಕೂತಿರುತ್ತದೆ. ಯಾಕೊ ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ.

ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯ ನೆಗಡಿಗೆ ಕಾರಣವಾಗುವ ಮಾಮೂಲು ವೈರಸ್ ಕೂಡ ದುರ್ಬಲರನ್ನು/ಅತಿವೃದ್ಧರನ್ನು ಬಲಿ ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ. ಪ್ರತಿ ವರ್ಷ 12-15 ಸಾವಿರ ಜನರು ಇಂಥ ಮಾಮೂಲು ನೆಗಡಿ ವೈರಸ್ಸಿನಿಂದ ಸಾಯುತ್ತಾರೆಂದು ಡಾ. ಬಿ.ಎಂ. ಹೆಗ್ಡೆ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಅಂಥ ಸಾವು ನಮ್ಮ ಸುತ್ತಮುತ್ತ ಸಂಭವಿಸಿದರೂ ನಾವು ಗಮನಿಸಿರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಅಷ್ಟೆ. 'ಹುಷಾರಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ/ವಯಸ್ಸಾಗಿತ್ತು' ಎಂದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತೇವೆ. 

ಎಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಹಿರಿಯ ನಾಗರಿಕರು ಹೀಗೆ ಸಾವಪ್ಪುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಪದ್ಮಭೂಷಣ ಡಾ. ಎಚ್ ನರಸಿಂಹಯ್ಯ ಹೀಗೆಯೇ ಕಾಲವಶರಾದರು. ಶ್ವಾಸಕೋಶದ ಸೋಂಕಿನಿಂದಲೇ ಸಾವಪ್ಪಿದ ಹಿರಿಯರು ನಿಮಗೂ ಗೊತ್ತಿರಬಹುದು. ಆ ಬಗೆಯ ನೆಗಡಿಗೆ ಕಾರಣವಾಗುವುದೂ ಕೊರೊನಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಎಂತಲೇ 1980ರ ದಶಕದಲ್ಲೇ ಮಿತ್ರ ಕೊಳ್ಳೇಗಾಲ ಶರ್ಮ ‘ತರಂಗ’ದಲ್ಲಿ ಲೇಖನ ಬರೆದಿದ್ದರು. ಈಗಿನ ನಾವೆಲ್ ಕೊರೊನಾ ಅದರ ಹೊಸರೂಪ. ತುಸು ಜಾಸ್ತಿ ಅಂಟುಗುಣ ಇದಕ್ಕಿದೆ ಮತ್ತೇನಿಲ್ಲ. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಹೆದರಿಕೊಂಡರೆ ದೇಹದ ರೋ.ಶ. ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗಿ ಕೋವಿಡ್ ಉಗ್ರವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಈಗ ಎಲ್ಲ ತಜ್ಞರೂ ಅದನ್ನೇ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
 
ಹೆದರಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸುವ ಮಾಧ್ಯಮಗಳು ತುಸು ಜೋರಾಗಿ ‘ಝೋನರಿಸಂ’ ತಮ್ಮಟೆ ಬಾರಿಸುತ್ತಿವೆ ಎಂದು ನಿಮಗೂ ಅನ್ನಿಸುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲವೆ?

ಕೋವಿಡ್ ನಿಂದ (ಅಥವಾ ಅದರ ಭಯದಿಂದ) ತುಸು ಜಾಸ್ತಿ ಜನ ಸಾಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ನಾವೆಲ್ಲರೂ ಎಚ್ಚರವಾಗಿರಬೇಕು; ಮುಖವಾಡ ಧರಿಸಿ ಓಡಾಡಬೇಕು (ಅದರಿಂದ ವಾಯುಮಾಲಿನ್ಯದ ಪರಿಣಾಮವೂ ತಗ್ಗುತ್ತದೆ); ದೈಹಿಕ ಅಂತರವನ್ನು ಕಾಯ್ದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು (ಅದರಿಂದ ಕ್ಯೂಗಳಲ್ಲಿನ ನೂಕು ನುಗ್ಗಲೂ ತಪ್ಪುತ್ತದೆ); ಕೈಕಾಲು ಮುಖ ತೊಳೆಯುತ್ತಿರಬೇಕು (ಅದನ್ನು ಪೂರ್ವಿಕರು ಹಿಂದೆಯೇ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಾರೆ). ಸಣ್ಣಪುಟ್ಟ ನೆಗಡಿ-ಕೆಮ್ಮಿಗೆಲ್ಲ ಡಾಕ್ಟರ್ ಬಳಿ ಓಡುವ, ಇಲ್ಲವೆ ಆಂಟಿಬಯಾಟಿಕ್ ನುಂಗುವ ಅಭ್ಯಾಸ ಇರಬಾರದು (ಹಿಂದೆಲ್ಲ ಆ ಅಭ್ಯಾಸ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ). ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲೇ ವಿಶ್ರಾಂತ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಲ್ಲಿರಬೇಕು.
 
ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲೇ ಕೋವಿಡ್ ಕಾಯಿಲೆಯಿಂದ ಗತಿಸಿದವರ ಅಂಕಿಸಂಖ್ಯೆಗಳೇ ಪ್ರಕಟವಾಗುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ; ಹಾಗೆ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕೋವಿಡ್‌ನಿಂದ ಸಾಯುವವರು ಇಲ್ಲವೇ ಇಲ್ಲವೆನ್ನುವಷ್ಟು ಅಪರೂಪ. ಯಾಕೆ ಹೇಳಿ? ನಮ್ಮ ಆಸ್ಪತ್ರೆಗಳೆಂದರೆ ನಾನಾ ಬಗೆಯ ವೈರಸ್ಸುಗಳ, ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳ ಸಂತೆ.
 
ಈಗ ಪ್ರಚಲಿತವಿರುವ ಅಂಕಿಸಂಖ್ಯೆಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನನಗೆ ನಾನಾ ಬಗೆಯ ಸಂದೇಹ ಕಾಡುತ್ತಿವೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೋವಿಡ್ ನಿಂದ ಗತಿಸಿದವರ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ 30 ಸಾವಿರ ಮುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಿದೆಯಂತೆ. ಇವರಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯ ನೆಗಡಿಯಿಂದ ಸತ್ತವರ (ಈ ನಾಲ್ಕು ತಿಂಗಳಲ್ಲಿ 5 ಸಾವಿರ ಜನ) ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯನ್ನು ವಜಾ ಮಾಡಬೇಕೋ ಬೇಡವೊ? 

ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಸರಾಸರಿ ಪ್ರತಿವರ್ಷ ಪ್ರತಿ ಸಾವಿರ ಜನರಲ್ಲಿ ಏಳು ಜನರು ಸಾಯುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆ ಅಂದಾಜು ಲೆಕ್ಕದ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನಾಲ್ಕು ತಿಂಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಏನಿಲ್ಲೆಂದರೂ 15-20 ಸಾವಿರ ಜನರು ಗತಿಸಿರಬೇಕು. ಅವರನ್ನೆಲ್ಲ ಬದಿಗಿಟ್ಟು ಕೊರೊನಾದಿಂದ  750 ಜನರ ಸಾವನ್ನಷ್ಟೇ ಎತ್ತಿ ಹೇಳಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಹಾಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಇವರೆಲ್ಲ ಬರೀ ಕೋವಿಡ್19ರಿಂದ ಸತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆಯೆ? ಹೃದಯಾಘಾತ, ಕಿಡ್ನಿವೈಫಲ್ಯ, ಕ್ಯಾನ್ಸರ್ ಇತ್ಯಾದಿಗಳಿಂದಾಗಿ ಗತಿಸಿದವರು ಇದರಲ್ಲಿ ಸೇರಿದ್ದಾರೆಯೆ?
  
ಅವರ ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊರೊನಾ ಯಾವ ಹಾನಿಯನ್ನೂ ಮಾಡದೆ ಗಪ್‌ಚಿಪ್ ಕೂತಿದ್ದರೂ ಅದನ್ನೇ ಅಪರಾಧಿ ಎಂದು ಬಿಂಬಿಸಬೇಕೆ? ಅಂಥವರನ್ನೂ ಕೊರೊನಾ ‘ಮೃತ್ಯುಪಾಶ’ದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಂಧಿಸಿ, ಅನಾಥ ಶವವಾಗಿ ಬಿಸಾಕಿದ್ದು ಯಾವ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಗೊತ್ತೆ? ಇದೇ ಝೋನರಿಸಂ. 
 
ಟಿವಿ, ಕಂಪ್ಯೂಟರ್, ಮೊಬೈಲ್ ಪರದೆಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಗಂಟೆಗಂಟೆಗೂ ಯಾರು ಅಂಕಿಸಂಖ್ಯೆಗಳನ್ನು ಸುರಿಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೊ,  ಅವು ಎಲ್ಲಿಂದ ಬಂತೆಂತಲೂ ಯಾರೂ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. (ಈ ಲೇಖನದ ಆರಂಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಕಾರ್ಟೂನನ್ನು ಮೀಮ್‌ me.me ಎಂಬ ವೆಬ್‌ಸೈಟಿನಿಂದ ಪಡೆದಿದ್ದು. ಮೀಮ್‌ ಅಂದರೆ ಮಿದುಳಿಗೆ ವಿಚಾರವೈರಸ್‌ಗಳನ್ನು ತುಂಬುವುದು). 
ಅಂಕಿಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ವಿಚಾರ ಬಂದಾಗ  ಕಾಝಿರಂಗಾ ಉದಾಹರಣೆ ನೋಡಿ. ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಳುಗಡೆ ಆಗಿದ್ದರಿಂದ 116 ವನ್ಯಜೀವಿಗಳು, ಅದರಲ್ಲೂ 13 ಘೇಂಡಾಗಳು ಸತ್ತವೆಂದು ನಿನ್ನೆ ಟಿವಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಚರ್ಚೆ ನಡೆಯಿತು. ಆದರೆ ಸತ್ತ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳ ಲೆಕ್ಕ ಹೇಗೆ ಸಿಕ್ಕಿತು? ಸುಮಾರು 850 ಚದರ ಕಿ.ಮೀ. ವಿಸ್ತೀರ್ಣದ ಆ ಉದ್ಯಾನದ ಬಹುಭಾಗ ನೀರಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಳುಗಿದ್ದಾಗ ಯಾರು ಡ್ರೋನ್ ಮೇಲೆ ಹೋಗಿ ಇಷ್ಟು ಶೀಘ್ರವಾಗಿ ಅಂಕಿಸಂಖ್ಯೆಗಳನ್ನು ಎತ್ತಿ ತಂದರು? ಡ್ರೋನ್‌ನಲ್ಲಿ ಅವು ಕಾಣುತ್ತವೆಯೆ? ಎಷ್ಟು ಸಾವಿರ ಬೋಟ್‌ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಅದೆಷ್ಟು ಲಕ್ಷ ಮುಳುಗುವೀರರು, ಗಣತಿ ಸೈನಿಕರು ಹೋಗಿ ಸಮೀಕ್ಷೆ ಮಾಡಿದರೊ? ಯಾರೂ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. 

ಆ ಅಷ್ಟೂ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳು ಸತ್ತಿದ್ದು ಹೇಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತೆ? ನೆರೆಯಿಂದಲ್ಲ, ಝೋನರಿಸಂನಿಂದ.
ಕೊರೊನಾ ಸೋಂಕುಮಾರಿ 50 ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಹಿಂದೆ ಬಂದಿತ್ತೆಂದು ಊಹಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಿ. ಆಗ ಟಿವಿ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ; ಕಂಪ್ಯೂಟರ್ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಕ್ಷಣಕ್ಷಣದ ಗ್ರಾಫ್ ಇರುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ಈ ಮಟ್ಟದ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಗಾಬರಿ, ಪ್ರಧಾನಿಯವರ ‘ಘಂಟಾ’ಘೋಷ ಇರುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ; ಬಾಲ್ಕನಿದೀಪ ಇರುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. 

ಆಗೆಲ್ಲ ಕೊರೊನಾ ಸಾಂಕ್ರಾಮಾರಿ ತಾನೇ ಮುಸುಕು ಹಾಕಿಕೊಂಡು ಗೂಢಚಾರಿಣಿ ಥರಾ ಬರಬೇಕಿತ್ತು ತಾನೆ? ಈ ಥರಾ ಲಾಕ್‌ಡೌನ್ ಮುಚ್ಚಳ ಹಾಕೋದು, ತೆರೆಯೋದು, ಕಾರ್ಮಿಕರು ಹೌಹಾರಿ ಮನೆಯ ಹಾದಿ ಹಿಡಿಯುವುದು -ಯಾವುದೂ ಇರುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. 

ಮಾರಿಗೆ ಬೆದರಿ ಇಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಆತ್ಮಹತ್ಯೆಗಳು, ಹೃದಯಾಘಾತಗಳು ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲವೇನೊ. ಹೆಚ್ಚೆಂದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ಮನೆಯ ಬಾಗಿಲ ಮೇಲೆ ‘ನಾಳೆ ಬಾ’ ಎಂಬ ಸೀಮೆಸುಣ್ಣದ ಬರಹ ಇರುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಗತಿಸಿದ ಯಾರೂ ಹೀಗೆ ಅನಾಥವಾಗಿ, statiಸ್ಟಿಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ.  ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಆಗ ಝೋನರಿಸಂ ಹಾವಳಿ ಅಷ್ಟಾಗಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ.
 
ಈಗ ಕಾಣುತ್ತಿರುವ ವಿಕಾರಗಳೆಲ್ಲ ಮಾಹಿತಿಕ್ರಾಂತಿಯ ರುದ್ರನರ್ತನವೇ ತಾನೆ?

ಮನುಕುಲವನ್ನು ಕಂಗೆಡಿಸಿದ ನಿಜವಾದ ಸಾಂಕ್ರಾಮಿಕ  ಅದು -ಮಾಹಿತಿಮಾರಿ! ಅದೇ ಇಂದು ಕೊರೊನಾ ಸುನಾಮಿಯನ್ನು ಸೃಷ್ಟಿಸಿದೆ. ಲಕ್ಷಾಂತರ ಉದ್ಯಮಗಳು ನೆಲ ಕಚ್ಚಿವೆ. ಅದೆಷ್ಟೊ ಕೋಟಿ ಮಂದಿ ನೆಲೆ ಕಳೆದುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. 
ಆದರೆ  ಇಲೆಕ್ಟ್ರಾನಿಕ್ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ಉದ್ಯಮ (ICT) ಮೆಡಿಕಲ್ ಉದ್ಯಮ, ಮತ್ತು ಅದರ ಬಾಲ ಹಿಡಿದು ಪ್ಲಾಸ್ಟಿಕ್ ಉದ್ಯಮ ಸಿಕ್ಕಾಪಟ್ಟೆ ಮೇಲೇಳುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಅವಕ್ಕೆ ಭುಜಬಲ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದು ಇದೇ ಝೋನರಿಸಂ.

ಈ ಮೂರೂ ಸೇರಿ ತೋಳೇರಿಸಿ ನಮ್ಮೆಲ್ಲರ ರಕ್ಷಕನ ವೇಷ ಧರಿಸಿ ನಿಂತಿವೆ.
 
ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ಏಳುನೂರು ಕೋಟಿ ಜನರ ತೋಳಿಗೆ ಸೂಜಿ ಚುಚ್ಚಿದ ನಂತರವೇ ಇವು ಹೊಸವೇಷ ತೊಡಲಿವೆ.

🦜- Exchanging noodles, rice, and sugar for a parrot...I need to speak to somebody. 

🦸🏻‍♂- Not even in my wildest dreams I imagine myself entering a Bank, wearing a mask and asking for money.

✋🏻🤚🏻- Never thought my hands will one day consume more alcohol than my liver...ever!

💀- Quarantine seems like a Netflix series...just when you think is over, they release the next season.

😷- I’m starting to like this mask thing...went to the supermarket and two people that I owe money to didn’t recognize me. 

📆- Who was complaining that 2020 didn’t have enough holidays...now what? 

😜- I need to social distance myself from my fridge; I tested positive in excess weight!

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦- Someone can tell me if the 2nd quarantine will be with the same family...
or we can change?

🖥- In just two weeks we will hear if there still two more weeks to let us know that two more weeks of quarantine are needed...

⏳- I’m not planning adding this 2020 to my age...I didn’t even use it!

😟- We want to publicly apologize to the year 2019 for all the bad things we said about it. 

🙎🏻‍♀- To all the ladies that were praying for their husbands to spend more time with them... how are you doing? 

🚰- My washing machine only accepts pijamas...I put a pair of jeans and a message came “stay home”!😷🏠

👀- If I see anyone on December 31 crying for this year ending, I will use a bottle in their head!

💉- After all that we have been through, the only thing missing is that the vaccine will be available only in suppository form. 

👨‍🦱👩🏼‍🦱- I feel like a teenager... no money in my wallet, hair long and out of control, thinking what to do with my life, and grounded home. 

Smile, release stress, and be safe! 😉👍🏻
❤❤❤

28/07/20, 21:42 - Baava: She is only talking anecdotally. .HCQ has not been shown to be effective in most of the studies published in high quality peer reviewed medical journals.. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2012410
28/07/20, 21:43 - Baava: https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/04-07-2020-who-discontinues-hydroxychloroquine-and-lopinavir-ritonavir-treatment-arms-for-covid-19
28/07/20, 21:45 - Baava: As this virus is a self limiting virus ( with most ppl getting cured with or without any treatment)a placebo controlled study is required which proves cause and effect definitively for a particular treatment. Else anecdotal evidence like the ones provided by this doc can prove more harm than good
28/07/20, 21:49 - Manumama: Currently all Indian institutes are getting treated big time . All doctors / paramedics ... on HCQ
28/07/20, 21:49 - Manumama: That’s the truth
28/07/20, 21:50 - Manumama: Currently there is no medicine worth mentioning to treat/ cure
28/07/20, 21:51 - Baava: Yeah..sadly this HCQ myth created a run on this medicine..one of my friend suffering from rheumatic arthritis couldn't get this drug which is needed for RM as ppl started buying HCQ
28/07/20, 21:53 - Manumama: Even in Mumbai ( not mentioning the Hosp) most doctors are on prophylactic and their infectivity is lowest .
28/07/20, 21:53 - Manumama: 90% on Indian medics are on this prophylaxis
28/07/20, 21:53 - Manumama: It’s easily available . Not an issue
28/07/20, 21:54 - Baava: Yes..for 2 weeks in March there was an issue
28/07/20, 21:54 - Baava: Now back to normal
28/07/20, 21:55 - Baava: Even some of my colleagues in Chennai are on this prophylaxis...but almost every quality study published rejects tha hypothesis
28/07/20, 21:55 - Manumama: WHO has lost credibility as far as COVID
28/07/20, 21:56 - Baava: Oh yes...but studies published in NJEM, JAMA etc also don't support HCQ hypothesis
28/07/20, 21:56 - Manumama: Problem is the studies are done far off
28/07/20, 21:56 - Baava: Ol
28/07/20, 21:56 - Manumama: Ironically Indians don’t have the publications
28/07/20, 21:57 - Baava: Yeah...not many publications sadly

08/08/20, 19:13 - Baava: While we can take solace in our mythology, the sad reality is our so called  'civilization' has seen approximately 1 Crore female foeticides since 1990s itself
08/08/20, 19:51 - Geethathe: Female foeticide is just one example.
08/08/20, 20:47 - Baava: True. But I was trying to contrast mythology ( as in stories) vs reality wrt the status of  women.   While we deify certain aspects of mythology,  it is not always a reflection of the realities of our collective  lived existence over several millennia as an Indian civilization. While it is tempting to talk about the "good" about our civilization, ( and most often with reference to 'mythologies'), it is only fair to point out  the not so good aspects of our civilization. Both in mythology and reality, our civilization is a case study of patriarchy, misogyny and discrimination ( eg: karna was rarely called Kunti putra but soota putra).   I believe we will only progress as a civilization if we are self critical of bad aspects.
 I think this topic will make for a good face to face discussion for the post Corona world☺️
08/08/20, 22:41 - Geethathe: Agreed  this discussion can't happen on whats app.As you said I wish and hope to progress as civilization 😊

🌹ತೌರ ಭಾಗಿಣ🌹

ಬಂಧುಗಳೆ 

ನನ್ನ ಅಮ್ಮನಿಗೆ ಗೌರಿ ಹಬ್ಬದ ತಿಂಗಳು ಬಂದರೆ ಏನು ಸಂಭ್ರಮ ಆ ದಿನ ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಬೇಗನೆ ಸಾನ್ನ ಪೂಜೆ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ತಿಂಡಿ ತಯಾರಿಸಿ ಇಟ್ಟು ಬಾಗಿಲಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾರದೋ ಬರುವಿಕೆಗಾಗಿ ಕಾಯುವುದು ಇದು ನಾನು ಚಿಕ್ಕವಳು ಅದಗಾಗಿನಿಂದ ನೋಡಿಕೂಂಡು ಬಂದಿರುವೆ
ಓಮ್ಮೆ ಕುತೂಹಲ ತಾಳಲಾರದೆ ಯಾರನ್ನು ಬಾಗಿಲ ಬಳಿ ಕಾಯುತ್ತಾ ಇರುವ ಅಮ್ಮ ಎಂದು  ಎಂದು ಕೇಳಿ ಬಿಟ್ಟೆ
ಅಮ್ಮನ ಆತಂಕದ ಉತ್ತರ ವಾರದಿಂದ ಕಾಯುತ್ತಿರುವೇ ನಮ್ಮ ಮನೆ ಬಳಿಗೆ ಪೋಸ್ಟ್ ಮ್ಯಾನ್ ಬರುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ
ನನ್ನ ತೌರು ಮನೆಯಿಂದ ನನಗೆ ಗೌರಿ ಭಾಗಿಣದ ಅಂತ ಮನಿಯಾಡ೯ರ್  ಬರ ಬೇಕಾಗಿತ್ತು ಎಂದಾಗ ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯ ವಾಯಿತು
ಅವರು ಎಷ್ಟು ರೂಪಾಯಿ ಕಳುಹಿಸುವರು ಎಂದು ಕೇಳಿದಾಗ 50 ರೂಪಾಯಿ ಎಂದಳು ಅಮ್ಮ
ನನಗೆ ನಗು ತಡೆಯಲಾಗುಲಿಲ್ಲ

ಅಮ್ಮ 50 ರೂಪಾಯಿಗಾಗಿ ಕಾಯಬೇಕಾ ಎಂದಾಗ ಅಮ್ಮನಿಗೆ ತುಸು ಕೋಪೋದ್ರಿಕ್ತ ಳು ಅದಳು
 ನನ್ನ ತೌರು ಮನೆಯವರು ಕಳುಹಿಸುವ ಆ 50 ರೂಪಾಯಿಗೆ ನನಗೆ ಲಕ್ಷ ರೂಪಾಯಿ ಗಿಂತ ಅಧಿಕ ಎಂದಳು. ನನಗೆ ಗೌರಿ ಹಬ್ಬದ ಮಂಗಳದವ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಕಳುಹಿಸುವುದ ಹಿಂದೆ ಇರುವ ಪ್ರೀತಿಯ ಬೆಲೆ ಗೂತ್ತಾ
ನಿನಗೂ ಮದುವೆ ಯಾಗಿ ಗಂಡನ ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೋಗು ಆಗ ತೌರ ಬೆಲೆ ತಿಳಿಯುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂದು ಬಡ ಬಡಿಸ ಹತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು

ಅವರು ಗೌರಿಭಾಗಿಣ ಎಂದು ಅರಿಶಿಣ ಕುಂಕುಮ ಬಳೆ ತೆಗೆದು ಕೂಳ್ಳಲು ತೌರ ಆಶೀರ್ವಾದ ದೂಂದಿಗೆ ಬರುವ ಹಣದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನಿನಗೇನು ಗೂತ್ತು M. O. ಫಾರಂ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕೆಳಗಡೆ ನನ್ನ ಅಪ್ಪ ಬರೆದ ಸಾಲುಗಳು ಎಷ್ಟು ಬಾರಿ ಓದಿದರು ಸಾಮಾಧನ ವಾಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಅವರ ಹರಕೆ ಯ ಮಾತು ಅದುಈ ಹಣವನ್ನು ಸ್ವಣ ಗೌರಿ ವ್ರತದ   ಬಾಗಿನಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಕಳುಹಿಸಿರುವೆ ಸುಮಂಗಲಿ ಸೌಭಾಗ್ಯವತಿ ಯಾಗಿ ಮಕ್ಕಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ಸಂತೋಷ ವಾಗಿರರುವುದು 
ಆಶೀರ್ವಾದ ಗಳು

ಈ ಸಾಲುಗಳು ನನ್ನ ಮುಂದಿನ ಗೌರಿ ಹಬ್ಬದ ತನಕ ಕಾಯುತ್ತದ್ದೆ ನನ್ನ ಮನದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರುತ್ತದೆ 
  ಎಂದು ಕಣ್ಣು ಒರೆಸಿಕೂಳ್ಳತ್ತ ಅಡಿಗೆ ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೋದಳು..
ಅಮ್ಮ ನಿತ್ಯ ವಜ್ರದ ಐದಾರು ಬಳೆ ಹಾಕಿ ಕೂಂಡಿರುವರವಷ್ಟು ನನ್ನ ಅಪ್ಪ ಸಿರಿವಂತರು
ಆದರೆ ಅಮ್ಮ ವಜ್ರದ ಬಳೆ ಗಳನ್ನು ಗೌರಿ ಹಬ್ಬದ ದಿನ ತೆಗೆದು ಹಾಕಿ ತನ್ನ ತೌರ ಮನೆಯವರದು ಕಳುಹಿಸಿದ ತೌರ ಭಾಗಿಣ ಹಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೈ ತುಂಬಾ ಗಾಜಿನ ಬಳೆ ಧರಿಸಿ ಸಂಭ್ರಮ ದಿಂದ ಓಡಾಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ನೆನಪು ಕಾಡುತ್ತದೆ
 ನನ್ನ ಅಪ್ಪ ನನ್ನ ಅಮ್ಮ ನ ಸಂತೋಷ ಕ್ಕ ಅಡ್ಡಿ ಬಂದವರಲ್ಲ

ನನಗೆ ಈಗ ಮದುವೆ ಯಾಗಿದೆ ಗೌರಿ ಹಬ್ಬದ ಅಮ್ಮನ ಚಟಪಟಿಕೆ ನನಗೆ ಬಂದಿದೆ ನನ್ನ ತೌರಿನವರು ಗೌರಿ ಭಾಗಿಣ ಈನ್ನೂ ಕಳುಹಿಸಲಿಲ್ಲ ವೆಂದು.

ಕಾಲ ಬದಲಾಗಿದೆ ತಾಂತ್ರಿಕತೆ ಬೆಳೆದಿದೆ ಅಣ್ಣ ತಮ್ಮಂದಿರ ಯಾರಿಗೂ ಬಿಡುವು ಇಲ್ಲ ಪೋಸ್ಟ್ ಆಫೀಸ್ ಹೋಗುವಷ್ಟ ವ್ಯವಧಾನ ವಿಲ್ಲ 
ಅಂದು ಅಂಚೆಯಣ್ಣ ತಂದು ಕೂಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಗೌರಿಭಾಗಿಣ ಹಣ ಇಂದು ಪೊನ್. Pay ಮೂಲಕ ಬಂದು ಬಾಂಕ್ಯ ಅಂಕೌಟಗೆ ಸಾವಿರಾರು ರೂಪಾಯಿ ಬರುತ್ತದೆ
ಹಬ್ಬದ ಹ ದಿನ  ಬಾಂಕ್ಯ ಅಂಕೌಟಗೆ ಹಣ ಬರುತ್ತದೆ ತೌರಿರಿಂದ ನಾನು ಅಮ್ಮನಂತೆ ಆಗಲೇ ಹೋಗಿ ಗಾಜಿನ ಬಳೆ ತರಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ ದ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ ಮೊಕ ರೋಧನೆ ಯಾರ ಬಳಿ ಹೇಳಲಿ ಅಮ್ಮನಿಲ್ಲ ತೌರಿನಲ್ಲಿ 

ಆದರೆ ಅಮ್ಮ ಹೇಳಿದಂತೆ ಮನಿ ಯಾಡ೯ರ್ ಫಾರಂ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕೆಳಗಡೆ ತೌರ ಆಶೀರ್ವಾದ ಪೂರ್ವಕವಾದ ಬರವಣಿಗೆ ಕಾಣೆಯಾಗಿದೆ. ಅಮ್ಮ ತೌರಿನಿಂದ ಬರುತ್ತಿದ್ದ 50 ರೂಪಾಯಿಗೆ ಪಡುವ ಸಂಭ್ರಮ ನಮಗೆ ಈಗ ಸಿಗುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ..

ಅಂದು ಅಮ್ಮನನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ ನಕ್ಕ ನಾನು ತೌರು ಮನೆಯ ಮಮತೆಯ ಹಂಬಲ ಕ್ಕೆ ಹಪ ಹಪಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವೇ ಅನ್ನಿಸುತ್ತೆ ನನಗೆ.
 ಮಾತನಾಡಿಸಲು ಯಾರಿಗೂ ಬಿಡುವು ಇಲ್ಲ ಯಾಂತ್ರಿಕ ಜೀವನ 
ಹೇಗಾದರೂ ಇರಲಿ ನನ್ನ ತೌರು ಚನ್ನಾಗಿ ಇರಲಿ ಎಂಬ ಬಯಕೆ ನನ್ನದು.. ತೌರಿನವರು ಪೋನ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾದರು ಮಾತನಾಡ ಬಹುದು ಎಂದು ಮನ ಬಯಸುತ್ತದೆ...... ಆದರೆ 
.............
Whatsapp ನ ತೌರ ಮನೆಯ  ಗ್ರೂಪ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಗೌರಿ ಗಣೇಶ ನ ಹಬ್ಬದ ಶುಭಾಶಯಗಳು ಎಂದು ಇರುತ್ತದೆ ಅಷ್ಟೇ

19/08/20, 16:52 - Puneeth: Exactly. What was he thinking. Gifting a G Wagon (INR 2 Crore) without knowing what colour she wants. He should have asked her what colour she wants and if it has to be with mavinkai or temple border 🤦‍♂️

30/08/20, 11:12 - Mummy: ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳು ತವರಿಗ್ಯಾಕೆ ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ?

ಏನನ್ನೂ ಕೊಂಡುಹೋಗಲು
ಬರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.

ಅವರ ಬೇರುಗಳಿಗೆ
ನೀರೆರೆಯಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ಅಣ್ಣತಮ್ಮಂದಿರ ಸುಖ
ಸಂತೋಷವನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ
ಆನಂದಿಸಲು ..
ತಮ್ಮ ಮಧುರ ಬಾಲ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹುಡುಕಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ತವರು ಮನೆಯ ಅಂಗಳದಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ನೇಹದ ದೀಪ ಬೆಳಗಿಸಿಡಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಯಾರ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ದೃಷ್ಟಿಯೂ ಬೀಳದಂತೆ
ಬಾಗಿಲಿಗೆ ರಕ್ಷೆ ಕಟ್ಟಲು
ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಮಮತೆಯ ಝರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ
ಮಿಂದು ಹೋಗಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ತಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿರುವುದೇನನ್ನೋ
ಕೊಟ್ಟುಹೋಗಲು ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ

ತಿರುಗಿ ಅತ್ತೆ ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೊರಟಾಗ
ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನೂ ಅಲ್ಲೇ ಬಿಟ್ಟು
ಹೊರಡುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ಎಲ್ಲರ ಮಂಜಾದ ಕಣ್ಣುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ
ತಮ್ಮ ನಸುನಗೆಯನ್ನು
ಈಜಲು ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ಅತೀ ಚಂಚಲ, ಅತಿ ಉತ್ಸಾಹದ
ಚಿಲುಮೆ ಆಗಿರುತ್ತಾಳೆ ಮಗಳು.
ಕೋಮಲ ಮನಸ್ಸಿನ ಮುಗ್ಧ
ಮಗಳು.. ಮಾತು ಮಾತಿಗೂ
ಅಳುವವಳು,.
ದೇವರ ಕೃಪೆಯಿಂದಷ್ಟೇ
ಹುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಾಳವಳು.

ಅವಳ ನಗುವಿಂದಲೇ
ಮನೆ ಸುಗಂಧಿತ..
ಪರರ ಮನೆಗೆ ಕಳುಹಿಸುವಾಗ
ಏನೋ ವಿಚಿತ್ರ ಸಂಕಟ.
ಮನೆ ಭಣಗುಟ್ಟಿಸಿ
ಎಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಅಳಿಸಿ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾರೆ

ತಾಯಿಯ ಪ್ರತಿಬಿಂಬ..
ತಂದೆಯ ಮುದ್ದಿನ 
ಕಣ್ಮಣಿ...
ದೇವರೇ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾನಂತೆ..
ತಾನು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಸಂತೋಷದಿಂದಿರುವಾಗ
ಹುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಾರೆ ಹೆಣ್ಣುಮಕ್ಕಳು.☺☺

11/11/20, 15:00 - Manumama: Indian bureaucracy- especially the IAS- is much maligned and while some criticism is indeed genuine & it needs urgent reforms, some is simply fake news. When Union Minister Nitin Gadkari in a humorous & incisive video criticized NHAI, he was both right and wrong at the same time about the bureaucracy.

04/12/20, 11:11 - Geethathe: Photographer Captures the Rainbows in Hummingbird Wings....

Australian photographer Christian Spencer has spent 19 years living in Brazil’s Itatiaia National Park, and one of the things he has focused his camera on is the beautiful sight of sunlight passing through hummingbird wings. His project is titled Winged Prism.

Hummingbirds are the smallest of birds, and some species can zip around at over 34 mph (54 km/h) while flapping their wings at over 80 times per second.

While studying these hard-to-photograph birds, Spencer noticed that the wings would create a prism-like effect when sunlight passed through them, causing rainbow colors to appear.

24/12/20, 21:46 - Krishna uncle: *ತಂಗಳನ್ನ, ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ಉತ್ಕೃಷ್ಟ ಉಪಹಾರ ಅಂದ್ರೆ ನಂಬ್ತಿರಾ?*

*ಕನ್ನಡದಲ್ಲಿ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ, ಇಂಗ್ಲೀಷಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸೋಕ್ಡ್ ರೈಸ್ ಅಂತ ಕರೆದರೆ, ತುಳುವಿನಲ್ಲಿ ತ೦ಞನವೆಂದೂ, ಮಲಯಾಳದಲ್ಲಿ ಪಝಕಂಜಿ , ತಮಿಳಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಪಝಯ ಸಾಧಮ್, ತೆಲುಗಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸದ್ಧಿ ಅನ್ನಮು ಎಂದೂ ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಇದು ಕಡುಬಡವರ ಆಹಾರ. ಪಾಮರರ ಊಟ. ಈ ದಿನದ ಬಿಸಿ ಬಿಸಿಯಾದ ಹೈ ಕ್ಯಾಲೋರಿಯ ಬ್ಯಾಲೆನ್ಸ್ಡ್ಆಹಾರವೆಲ್ಲಿ ?*

 *ಈ ತಂಗಳನ್ನವೆಲ್ಲಿ?* *ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯ ವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ*

*ಆದರೆ ಕಾಲಚಕ್ರ ತಿರುಗಿದೆ. ಅಮೇರಿಕನ್ ನ್ಯೂಟ್ರಿಷನ್ ಅಸೋಸಿಯೇಷನ್ ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ವಿವಿಧ ಪ್ರದೇಶಗಳ, ವಿವಿಧ ದೇಶಗಳ, ವಿವಿಧ ಜನಾಂಗಗಳ ಆಹಾರ ಪದ್ಧತಿಯನ್ನು ಅಧ್ಯಯನ ಮಾಡಿ ನಮ್ಮ  ತ0ಗಳನ್ನವನ್ನು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ‘ಬೆಸ್ಟ್ ಬ್ರೇಕ್ ಫಾಸ್ಟ್ ‘ ಎಂದು ಸರ್ಟಿಫೈ ಮಾಡಿದೆ*

*ಹಿಂದೆಲ್ಲಾ ಹಳ್ಳಿಯ ಜನರು ತಾವು ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗುವ ಮೊದಲು ರಾತ್ರಿ ಬಾಕಿ ಉಳಿದ ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನೆನೆಸಿಟ್ಟ ಅನ್ನವನ್ನು 4 ಕಲ್ಲು ಉಪ್ಪು, ಒಂದು ಹಸಿಮೆಣಸು ಇರಿದು ಅದಕ್ಕೆ  ನುಗ್ಗಿಸಿ,  ಒಂದು ಕಪ್ಪು ಕೆನೆಮೊಸರು ಹಾಕಿ ಕಲಸಿಕೊಂಡು ತಿಂದು ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.*

*ಹಾಗೆ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ ಜೊತೆ ಹಾಕಿ ತಿನ್ನಲು ಉಪ್ಪು-ಹಸಿಮೆಣಸುವೇ ಆಗಬೇಕಾಗಿಲ್ಲ.*
*ಒಂದು ತುಂಡು ಉಪ್ಪಿನಕಾಯಿ, ಕೆಂಡದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಿಸುಟು ಸುಟ್ಟ ಒಣಮೆಣಸು, ತೆಂಗಿನಕಾಯಿ ಚಟ್ನಿ- ಯಾವುದಾದರೂ ಸರಿ ಹೊಂದಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಾಗೆ ತಿಂದು ಗದ್ದೆಯ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಳಿದರೆ ಮಧ್ಯಾಹ್ನ 2 ಗಂಟೆಯವರೆಗೂ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆ ಅಲ್ಲಾಡಲ್ಲ!!!!!*

*ಇವತ್ತು ಭಾರತವೂ ಸೇರಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣ-ಪೂರ್ವ ಏಷ್ಯಾದ ಹಳ್ಳಿ ಜನರ ಒಂದು ಆಹಾರ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಇದಾಗಿದೆ. ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಭಾರತೀಯರಾದ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ, ಕೇರಳ, ತಮಿಳುನಾಡು ಮತ್ತು ಆಂಧ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಆಹಾರ ಪದಾರ್ಥದ ಮಹತ್ವ ಒಂದೆರಡಲ್ಲ* *ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನೆನೆಸಿ ಇಡುವುದರಿಂದ ಅನ್ನದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಲ್ಯಾಕ್ಟಿಕ್ ಆಸಿಡ್, ನ್ಯೂಟ್ರಿಷನ್ ಆಗಿ ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆಸಿಗಲಾರದ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಿಂದ, ಮನುಷ್ಯ ದೇಹ ಹೀರಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬಹುದಾದ ಕಬ್ಬಿಣ ಮತ್ತು ಕ್ಯಾಲ್ಸಿಯಂ ಅಂಶಗಳನ್ನು ಅಂಶಗಳನ್ನಾಗಿ ಬದಲಾಯಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಹನ್ನೆರಡು ಗಂಟೆ ನೆನೆಸಿಟ್ಟ 100 ಗ್ರಾಂ ಕುಚ್ಚುಲಕ್ಕಿಯಲ್ಲಿ 3.4 ಮಿಲಿ ಗ್ರಾಂ ಇದ್ದ ಕಬ್ಬಿಣದ ಅಂಶವು 73.91 ಮಿಲಿ ಗ್ರಾಂ ವರೆಗೆ, ಅಂದರೆ, ಕಬ್ಬಿಣದ ಅಂಶವು ಅಂದರೆ 2073 % ನಷ್ಟು ವೃದ್ಧಿಗೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ !*

*ಹೀಗೆ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ ತಿನ್ನುವುದರಿಂದ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಅತಿಯಾದ ಉಷ್ಣದ ಅಂಶ ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗಿ ದೇಹವನ್ನು ತಂಪಾಗಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಬೇಡದ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳನ್ನು ತೊಲಗಿಸಿ ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆ ಅಗತ್ಯವಿರುವ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾವನ್ನು ಟ್ರಿಲಿಯನ್ ಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಉತ್ಪತ್ತಿಮಾಡುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಈ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳು ನಮ್ಮ ದೈನಂದಿನ ಜೀರ್ಣಕ್ರಿಯೆಯನ್ನು ಚುರುಕುಗೊಳಿಸಲು ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುತ್ತವೆ ಮತ್ತು ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿನ ರೋಗನಿರೋಧಕ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಬಲಪಡಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.ಅಲ್ಲದೆ ತಂಗಳನ್ನದ ಬಳಕೆಯಿಂದ ದೇಹದ ಆಂತರಿಕ ಅಂಗಗಳ ಸಮರ್ಪಕ ಕಾರ್ಯ ನಿರ್ವಹಣೆಗೆ ಪ್ರೋತ್ಸಾಹಿಸಿ ಆ ಅಂಗಗಳನ್ನು ಕಾಪಾಡುತ್ತದೆ.ತಂಗಳನ್ನವು ದೇಹವನ್ನು ತಂಪಾಗಿಡುತ್ತದೆ*.

*ದೇಹ ಹಗುರವಾಗಿ ಫೀಲ್ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ ಮತ್ತು ಮನಸ್ಸು ಹಗುರವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಯ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು ಕರಗಿಹೋಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಮಲಬದ್ಧತೆ ನಿವಾರಣೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನಮ್ಮನ್ನು ದಿನವಿಡೀ ಉಲ್ಲಾಸಮಯವಾಗಿಡುತ್ತದೆ. ತಂಗಳನ್ನ ಉಂಡ ಮೇಲೆ ಟೀ-ಕಾಫಿ ಮುಂತಾದ ಪಾನೀಯಗಳಿಗೆ ದೇಹದಿಂದ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಮೂಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯದ ಸಂಗತಿಯೆಂದರೆ ಬಿ 6 ಮತ್ತು ಬಿ 12- ಈ ಎರಡು ವಿಟಮಿನ್ ಗಳು ಹೇರಳವಾಗಿ ತಂಗಳನ್ನದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಗುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಸಾಧಾರಣವಾಗಿ ಇವು ಶಾಖಾಹಾರಿ ಆಹಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲ.ಇವೆಲ್ಲ ಅಲ್ಲದೆ, ಇದರಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಮೆಗ್ನೀಷಿಯಂ ಖನಿಜ ಪದಾರ್ಥಗಳು ದೇಹದ ಎಲುಬುಗಳನ್ನು ಗಟ್ಟಿಗೊಳಿಸಿ ದೇಹ ಸವಕಳಿಯ ರೋಗಗಳಾದ ಅರ್ಥರೈಟಿಸ್ ಮತ್ತು ಕ್ಯಾನ್ಸೆರ್ ಅನ್ನು ತಡೆಯುವಲ್ಲಿ ಸಹಕಾರಿ ಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.*  
*ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿನ ಆಂತರಿಕ ಬೆಳವಣಿಗೆಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ,* *ಇದು ಬಾಹ್ಯ ಸೌಂದರ್ಯವನ್ನು ಕೂಡ ವೃದ್ಧಿಸಬಲ್ಲದು.* 
*ಚರ್ಮವು ಕಾಂತಿಯುಕ್ತವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ ಮತ್ತು ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆ ವಯಸ್ಸಾಗುವ ಪ್ರಕ್ರಿಯೆಯನ್ನು ನಿಧಾನಗೊಳಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಒಟ್ಟಾರೆಯಾಗಿ ಚಾಲ್ತಿಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಹೈಕ್ಯಾಲೊರಿ ಆಹಾರದ ಎದುರು ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿರಿಯರು ಸಾವಿರಾರು ವರ್ಷಗಳಿಂದ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದ ತಂಗಳನ್ನವು ಎಲ್ಲ ರೀತಿಯಿಂದಲೂ ಒಂದು ಸರಳ ಮತ್ತು ಪರ್ಫೆಕ್ಟ್ ಮುಂಜಾನೆಯ ಆಹಾರವಾಗಿದೆ*.
*ಪೌಷ್ಟಿಕತೆ ಆಹಾರದ ಒಂದು ಗುಣ. ಪೌಷ್ಟಿಕತೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮುಖ್ಯವಲ್ಲ. ಪೌಷ್ಟಿಕತನವಲ್ಲದೆ, ಆಯುರ್ವೇದದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೇಳಿದ ಮೂರು ತರಹದ ದೋಷಗಳಾದ ವಾತ, ಪಿತ್ತ ಮತ್ತು ಕಫ ನಿವಾರಕವಾಗಿಯೂ ಆಹಾರವಿರಬೇಕು.*
 *ಆ ಎಲ್ಲ ಅರ್ಹತೆ ನಮ್ಮ ತಂಗಳನ್ನಕ್ಕೆ ಇದೆ.*
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
24/12/20, 21:48 - Krishna uncle: ನಾನು ಚಿಕ್ಕಂದಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಎರಡು ಜನ್ಮಕ್ಕಾಗುವಷ್ಟು ನೀರು ಹೂದ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ, ಮೊಸರು ತಿಂದಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ನನ್ನ ಬಾಲ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದು ನನಗೆ ಬಹಳ ಇಷ್ಟವಾದ ಬ್ರೆಕ್ ಫಾಸ್ಟ್.

16/01/21, 16:12 - Kampa Aunt: *_Some Very Interesting, but very scary Predictions for the Future.._*

*1-Conventional Car Repair workshops* will vanish over a period of time.

*2-A Petrol Engine /Diesel Engine-driven Car has almost 20,000 individual components* 
An electrical Vehicle has less than 50.

*In future, Electric cars will be sold with a life-time Warranty* and will be repaired only by authorised outlets.. It will take only a few minutes to remove and replace an Electric Motor in a Battery-powered Vehicle.

*3-Faulty electric motors* are not repaired in the conventional car workshops teaming with Mechanics,, but will be sent to an automated Repair shop that repairs them using Robots.

*4-The Electric motor in your Electric Vehicle malfunctions- A warning light goes on* --
so you drive up to what looks like a car wash, and your car is towed inside. While you have a cup of coffee,  out comes your car with a repaired Electric motor !

*5-Petrol Pumps* will go away.

*6-Street corners will have Power meters that will dispense Electricity*
 Power Companies/ Utility companies will install Electrical recharging stations at street corners.. In fact, they’ve already started in advanced countries like Sweden, Denmark and Holland.

*7-Smart major Auto manufacturers across the world like Honda, Toyota and Samsung* have already invested Billions of Dollars to start building new Manufacturing plants that will only build Electric cars. 

*8-Coal Mining industry* will sink without a trace. Petroleum companies will vanish.  Drilling for oil will gradually reduce. Say good-bye to the power-wielding *OPEC*
The Middle-East is heading for trouble.

*9-Homes will produce and store more Electrical energy during the daytime and will consume only a part of the power generated & will sell most of the power back to the powergrid. The powergrid will store the power and will distribute the power to industries that are high-intensive power users. Has anybody thought of a *Tesla* on the  roof ??

*10-A baby of today, will only see personal cars in Museums* 
The future, an Era of disruption, is approaching faster than most of us can handle.

*11-In 1980, Kodak had 170,000 employees worldwide and sold 85% of all photographic film-rolls across the world*. 
Within just a couple of decades, their business model crashed and *Kodak* went bankrupt. Who would have thought of that ever happening ??

*12-What happened to Kodak and Polaroid* will happen to a lot of industries in the next  5-10 years … and most people don't see them coming.

*13-Did you think in 2000* that five years later, you would never take pictures using photographic film again ? With today’s smart phones, who owns a Camera these days ??

*14-Digital Cameras* were invented around 1975. The initial models only had clarity/ resolution of 10,000 pixels, but improved vastly following Moore's laws, as it happens with all futuristic technologies

*15-It will now happen again (but much faster) with Artificial Intelligence* Medical Diagnostics, Autonomous Electric cars, Online education, 3D Printing, Hydroponic Agriculture will change the world, beyond imagination.

*16-Forget the old book- Future Shock* Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution.

*17-Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and 3D Printing* have already disrupted and will continue to disrupt most traditional Manufacturing industries in the next ten years.

*18-UBER* is just a software company- they don't own any cars and *Uber* is now the biggest taxi company in the world. Ask any taxi driver if any of them, saw that coming.

*19-AirBnB* is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any hotel properties. Ask Hilton or Meridian Hotels if they saw that coming. 

*20-Artificial Intelligence:* Computers will become exponentially powerful &  more accurate in understanding all facets of  the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go-player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected.

*21-In the USA,* young lawyers already don't get jobs easily. Because of  *IBM's Watson*, you can get legal advice ( right now, only the basic legal advic

e) within seconds, with 90% accuracy as compared with 70% accuracy when given by human beings. So, if you are planning to study law, please change your career plan. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, only super-specialists will remain.

*22-IBM Watson* already helps Doctors in diagnosing Cancer. *IBM Watson* is many times more accurate than human Doctors.

*23-Facebook* now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. In 2030, computers will become far more  intelligent than humans.

*24-Autonomous cars:* In 2020 several models of self-driving cars are already launched. In the next five years, the entire industry will  be disrupted. You don't need to own a car anymore as you will call a car with your mobile phone, it will show up at your location and will drive you to your destination.

*25-You will not need to park your car* you will only pay only for the driven distance and you can be productive, while being driven in a driverless car. *The younger children of today's generation, will never get a Driver's license and will never own a car*

*26-This will change our cities* because we will need 90% fewer cars. We can transform parking spaces into green parks.

*27-About 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide* including distracted drivers or due to drunk driving. We now have one accident for every 60,000 miles of driving. With Autonomous driving that will probably drop to 1 accident in 6 million miles of driving. That will save almost a million lives  worldwide each year. 

*28-Most traditional car companies will doubtless become financially unviable, with their current business models*
They will try the traditional evolutionary approach and try to build better cars, while Tech companies ( *Tesla, Apple, Google* ) will take up a revolutionary approach and build a Computer on wheels.

*29-Look at what Volvo is doing right now*
 No more Internal Combustion Engines in their Cars starting with the year 2025, using mostly Electric Motors, with the intent of phasing out Hybrid models.

*30-Engineers* from Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen and Audi are completely terrified of *Tesla* 
Look at all the global companies offering Electric vehicles. They were unheard of, only a few years ago.

*31-Insurance companies will have massive trouble* Without many road accidents, the Insurance Premiums will crash. The car insurance business will taper down with the passage of time.

*32-Real Estate Business models* will undergo drastic change. Because if you can work on your Laptop while you commute, people will abandon their down-town apartments, to move far away to more beautiful and affordable neighbourhoods in distant suburbs.

*33-Electric cars* will become mainstream by 2040. Cities will be less noisy because all new cars will run mostly on Batteries.

*34-Cities will have much cleaner Ambient atmosphere, with no pollution* 
And clean air as well.

*35-Renewable Power* will become incredibly cheap, apart from being clean.

*36-Solar power production* has been on an exponential growth-curve for the last 30 years, but you can now see the burgeoning impact.  And it’s just getting ramped up with the price of Solar Power( per Kilo-Watt-Hour) falling down every year.

*37-Fossil Energy in trouble* 
Tech companies are trying new methods to limit access to the power grid, to prevent competition from low-cost home-based solar installations.

*38-Health:*   There will be Tech companies which will build Medical devices that work on your Mobile phone, which can take your Retina scan, your blood sample and you breath into it.  Then, they will  analyse  Bio-markers that will identify nearly any Disease. There will be dozens of Mobile phone apps for Medical Diagnostics.

*WELCOME TO TOMORROW'S WORLD*

17/01/21, 10:45 - Baava: Around 400 ppl die per day in Norway on an average. Most of them are elderly people. So many folks who received vaccine will also die.  Hopefully correlation is not causation, especially in this case
17/01/21, 10:47 - Baava: <Media omitted>
17/01/21, 10:53 - Baava: Around 1.5L to 1.6 L ppl die each day in the world. A majority of them old ppl.  And as most countries are vaccinating old people, and a significant % would have died anyways, I think we will see more of these news which will link deaths to vaccination.. hopefully most of not all will not be related to vaccination...
17/01/21, 10:56 - Baava: 😀 nothing like having one's priorities sorted out.

I had a team member who was an insomniac due to depression, who took long leave and never returned to work. I think the challenge is how to recognise serious and support serious mental health issues while preventing misuse by some folks.

04/02/21, 15:09 - Kampa Aunt: *ತಂಗಳನ್ನ, ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ಉತ್ಕೃಷ್ಟ ಉಪಹಾರ ಅಂದ್ರೆ ನಂಬ್ತಿರಾ?*

*ಕನ್ನಡದಲ್ಲಿ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ, ಇಂಗ್ಲೀಷಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸೋಕ್ಡ್ ರೈಸ್ ಅಂತ ಕರೆದರೆ, ತುಳುವಿನಲ್ಲಿ ತ೦ಞನವೆಂದೂ, ಮಲಯಾಳದಲ್ಲಿ ಪಝಕಂಜಿ, ತಮಿಳಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಪಝಯ ಸಾಧಮ್, ತೆಲುಗಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸದ್ಧಿ ಅನ್ನಮು ಎಂದೂ ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಇದು ಕಡುಬಡವರ ಆಹಾರ. ಪಾಮರರ ಊಟ. ಈ ದಿನದ ಬಿಸಿ ಬಿಸಿಯಾದ ಹೈ ಕ್ಯಾಲೋರಿಯ ಬ್ಯಾಲೆನ್ಸ್ಡ್ಆಹಾರವೆಲ್ಲಿ?*

*ಈ ತಂಗಳನ್ನವೆಲ್ಲಿ?* *ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯ ವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಆದರೆ ಕಾಲಚಕ್ರ ತಿರುಗಿದೆ. ಅಮೇರಿಕನ್ ನ್ಯೂಟ್ರಿಷನ್ ಅಸೋಸಿಯೇಷನ್ ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ವಿವಿಧ ಪ್ರದೇಶಗಳ, ವಿವಿಧ ದೇಶಗಳ, ವಿವಿಧ ಜನಾಂಗಗಳ ಆಹಾರ ಪದ್ಧತಿಯನ್ನು ಅಧ್ಯಯನ ಮಾಡಿ ನಮ್ಮ  ತ0ಗಳನ್ನವನ್ನು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ‘ಬೆಸ್ಟ್ ಬ್ರೇಕ್ ಫಾಸ್ಟ್ ‘ ಎಂದು ಸರ್ಟಿಫೈ ಮಾಡಿದೆ.*

*ಹಿಂದೆಲ್ಲಾ ಹಳ್ಳಿಯ ಜನರು ತಾವು ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗುವ ಮೊದಲು ರಾತ್ರಿ ಬಾಕಿ ಉಳಿದ ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನೆನೆಸಿಟ್ಟ ಅನ್ನವನ್ನು 4 ಕಲ್ಲು ಉಪ್ಪು, ಒಂದು ಹಸಿಮೆಣಸು ಇರಿದು ಅದಕ್ಕೆ  ನುಗ್ಗಿಸಿ, ಒಂದು ಕಪ್ಪು ಕೆನೆಮೊಸರು ಹಾಕಿ ಕಲಸಿಕೊಂಡು ತಿಂದು ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.*

*ಹಾಗೆ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ ಜೊತೆ ಹಾಕಿ ತಿನ್ನಲು ಉಪ್ಪು, ಹಸಿಮೆಣಸೇ ಆಗಬೇಕಾಗಿಲ್ಲ.*
*ಒಂದು ತುಂಡು ಉಪ್ಪಿನಕಾಯಿ, ಕೆಂಡದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಿಸುಟು ಸುಟ್ಟ ಒಣಮೆಣಸು, ತೆಂಗಿನಕಾಯಿ ಚಟ್ನಿ - ಯಾವುದಾದರೂ ಸರಿ ಹೊಂದಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಾಗೆ ತಿಂದು ಗದ್ದೆಯ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಳಿದರೆ ಮಧ್ಯಾಹ್ನ 2 ಗಂಟೆಯವರೆಗೂ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆ ಅಲ್ಲಾಡಲ್ಲ!!!!!*

*ಇವತ್ತು ಭಾರತವೂ ಸೇರಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣ-ಪೂರ್ವ ಏಷ್ಯಾದ ಹಳ್ಳಿ ಜನರ ಒಂದು ಆಹಾರ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಇದಾಗಿದೆ. ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಭಾರತೀಯರಾದ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ, ಕೇರಳ, ತಮಿಳುನಾಡು ಮತ್ತು ಆಂಧ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಳಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಆಹಾರ ಪದಾರ್ಥದ ಮಹತ್ವ ಒಂದೆರಡಲ್ಲ.* 
*ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನೆನೆಸಿ ಇಡುವುದರಿಂದ ಅನ್ನದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಲ್ಯಾಕ್ಟಿಕ್ ಆಸಿಡ್, ನ್ಯೂಟ್ರಿಷನ್ ಆಗಿ ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆಸಿಗಲಾರದ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಿಂದ, ಮನುಷ್ಯ ದೇಹ ಹೀರಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬಹುದಾದ ಕಬ್ಬಿಣ ಮತ್ತು ಕ್ಯಾಲ್ಸಿಯಂ ಅಂಶಗಳನ್ನು ಅಂಶಗಳನ್ನಾಗಿ ಬದಲಾಯಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಹನ್ನೆರಡು ಗಂಟೆ ನೆನೆಸಿಟ್ಟ 100 ಗ್ರಾಂ ಕುಚ್ಚುಲಕ್ಕಿಯಲ್ಲಿ 3.4 ಮಿಲಿ ಗ್ರಾಂ ಇದ್ದ ಕಬ್ಬಿಣದ ಅಂಶವು 73.91 ಮಿಲಿ ಗ್ರಾಂ ವರೆಗೆ, ಅಂದರೆ, ಕಬ್ಬಿಣದ ಅಂಶವು ಅಂದರೆ 2073% ನಷ್ಟು ವೃದ್ಧಿಗೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ!*

*ಹೀಗೆ ತಂಗಳನ್ನ ತಿನ್ನುವುದರಿಂದ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಅತಿಯಾದ ಉಷ್ಣದ ಅಂಶ ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗಿ ದೇಹವನ್ನು ತಂಪಾಗಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಬೇಡದ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳನ್ನು ತೊಲಗಿಸಿ ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆ ಅಗತ್ಯವಿರುವ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾವನ್ನು ಟ್ರಿಲಿಯನ್ ಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಉತ್ಪತ್ತಿಮಾಡುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಈ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್ಟೀರಿಯಾಗಳು ನಮ್ಮ ದೈನಂದಿನ ಜೀರ್ಣಕ್ರಿಯೆಯನ್ನು ಚುರುಕುಗೊಳಿಸಲು ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುತ್ತವೆ ಮತ್ತು ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿನ ರೋಗನಿರೋಧಕ ಶಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಬಲಪಡಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಅಲ್ಲದೆ ತಂಗಳನ್ನದ ಬಳಕೆಯಿಂದ ದೇಹದ ಆಂತರಿಕ ಅಂಗಗಳ ಸಮರ್ಪಕ ಕಾರ್ಯ ನಿರ್ವಹಣೆಗೆ ಪ್ರೋತ್ಸಾಹಿಸಿ ಆ ಅಂಗಗಳನ್ನು ಕಾಪಾಡುತ್ತದೆ. ತಂಗಳನ್ನವು ದೇಹವನ್ನು ತಂಪಾಗಿಡುತ್ತದೆ*.

*ದೇಹ ಹಗುರವಾಗಿ ಫೀಲ್ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ ಮತ್ತು ಮನಸ್ಸು ಹಗುರವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಯ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು ಕರಗಿಹೋಗುತ್ತವೆ. ಮಲಬದ್ಧತೆ ನಿವಾರಣೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನಮ್ಮನ್ನು ದಿನವಿಡೀ ಉಲ್ಲಾಸಮಯವಾಗಿಡುತ್ತದೆ. ತಂಗಳನ್ನ ಉಂಡ ಮೇಲೆ ಟೀ-ಕಾಫಿ ಮುಂತಾದ ಪಾನೀಯಗಳಿಗೆ ದೇಹದಿಂದ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಮೂಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯದ ಸಂಗತಿಯೆಂದರೆ ಬಿ 6 ಮತ್ತು ಬಿ 12 - ಈ ಎರಡು ವಿಟಮಿನ್ ಗಳು ಹೇರಳವಾಗಿ ತಂಗಳನ್ನದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಗುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಸಾಧಾರಣವಾಗಿ ಇವು ಶಾಖಾಹಾರಿ ಆಹಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಇವೆಲ್ಲ ಅಲ್ಲದೆ, ಇದರಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಮೆಗ್ನೀಷಿಯಂ ಖನಿಜ ಪದಾರ್ಥಗಳು ದೇಹದ ಎಲುಬುಗಳನ್ನು ಗಟ್ಟಿಗೊಳಿಸಿ ದೇಹ ಸವಕಳಿಯ ರೋಗಗಳಾದ ಅರ್ಥರೈಟಿಸ್ ಮತ್ತು ಕ್ಯಾನ್ಸೆರ್ ಅನ್ನು ತಡೆಯುವಲ್ಲಿ ಸಹಕಾರಿ ಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.*  
*ದೇಹದಲ್ಲಿನ ಆಂತರಿಕ ಬೆಳವಣಿಗೆಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ,* *ಇದು ಬಾಹ್ಯ ಸೌಂದರ್ಯವನ್ನು ಕೂಡ ವೃದ್ಧಿಸಬಲ್ಲದು.* 
*ಚರ್ಮವು ಕಾಂತಿಯುಕ್ತವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ ಮತ್ತು ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆ ವಯಸ್ಸಾಗುವ ಪ್ರಕ್ರಿಯೆಯನ್ನು ನಿಧಾನಗೊಳಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.*

*ಒಟ್ಟಾರೆಯಾಗಿ ಚಾಲ್ತಿಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಹೈಕ್ಯಾಲೊರಿ ಆಹಾರದ ಎದುರು ನಮ್ಮ ಹಿರಿಯರು ಸಾವಿರಾರು ವರ್ಷಗಳಿಂದ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದ ತಂಗಳನ್ನವು ಎಲ್ಲ ರೀತಿಯಿಂದಲೂ ಒಂದು ಸರಳ ಮತ್ತು ಪರ್ಫೆಕ್ಟ್ ಮುಂಜಾನೆಯ ಆಹಾರವಾಗಿದೆ*.
*ಪೌಷ್ಟಿಕತೆ ಆಹಾರದ ಒಂದು ಗುಣ. ಪೌಷ್ಟಿಕತೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮುಖ್ಯವಲ್ಲ. ಪೌಷ್ಟಿಕತನವಲ್ಲದೆ, ಆಯುರ್ವೇದದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೇಳಿದ ಮೂರು ತರಹದ ದೋಷಗಳಾದ ವಾತ, ಪಿತ್ತ ಮತ್ತು ಕಫ ನಿವಾರಕವಾಗಿಯೂ ಆಹಾರವಿರಬೇಕು.*
 *ಆ ಎಲ್ಲ ಅರ್ಹತೆ ನಮ್ಮ ತಂಗಳನ್ನಕ್ಕೆ ಇದೆ.*

09/05/21, 09:34 - Baava: Vaccines are extremely effecy in preventing death. In case, if anyone is a vaccine skeptic, show them these. We are seeing 500 deaths in KA today. If not for vaccines in 45+ it could have been closer to 1000 per day
09/05/21, 09:46 - Baava: And for those who think this wave 2 was sudden. It was not. The curve was showing exponential characteristics  as early as Feb end itself. A lot of folks flagged this by March 1st week. We did nothing  till elections and Kumbh got over. What is happening now is due to ignorance of basic scientific temper at best or wilful muder at worst.  We have a bias  towards big numbers like 40K and 50K cases. When cases doubled to 2K from 1K in no time is when we shd have been worried about this < end of rant>

09/05/21, 10:04 - Puneeth: 👍🏻
09/05/21, 10:04 - Baava: This is the exponential curve. If one differentiates this at any point in the curve, the resultant is also an exponential equation.  Visually we may feel that things got worse later, but it is not the case. The curve was exponential even by Feb end.

The deaths ( assuming 2 weeks lag) should have been 100 /day by now  going by wave 1 numbers. ( Wave 1 peak we reached max 20% TPR) Vaccination has already saved hundreds of lives in Mys district.

04/12/21, 16:38 - Baava: So, after many months, i am messaging again on the pandemic..and this time of Omicron.. Trying to summarize what we know now and what we may have to do.
04/12/21, 16:38 - Baava: 1/n.  Omicron: should we be worried? It depends on these
a.	Is it more transmissible
b.	It is more virulent? That is, does it cause more ‘severe disease’ compared to other variants
c.	How does being  vaccinated and/or being prior infected affect (a) and (b) 

Though it is early days, and there is uncertainty, there is a lot of data out there from SA which have are being  analyzed by scientists, epidemiologists, virologists and mathematical modelers. I will try to summarize some of them.
04/12/21, 16:38 - Baava: 2/n. Omicron in SA is displaying unprecedented epi curves..not only for covid, but for any disease known to us!!  The graph shows exponential growth of cases with doubling time of just 3 days. Note the graph is on log scale and not on linear scale. 
This means this is clearly much more transmissible than any other variant.. and in an exponential sense. That means, a few hundred cases today will become a hundreds of thousands of  cases in a matter of days.
04/12/21, 16:38 - Baava: <Media omitted>
04/12/21, 16:38 - Baava: 3/n. 24% of South Africans have been vaccinated and it is estimated 80%+ have been infected naturally. So is this an immune escape variant? That is, are people protected from infection if they have been infected earlier and/or if they have been vaccinated. Epidemiological data from South Africa shows a 350%  increase in risk for reinfection due to Omicron even if someone has been naturally infected earlier! . These findings provide epidemiological evidence for Omicron’s ability to evade immunity from prior infection. The paper can be seen here:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2
04/12/21, 16:39 - Baava: 4/n.  There is no concrete data yet if prior vaccination is preventing someone from getting infected by Omicron. But it is theorized that spike protein based vaccines (either mRNA or adenovirus vectored vaccines like Covishield) may offer some protection. Also vaccines were primarily designed to protect people from severe disease and its main goal was NOT to prevent someone from catching the infection. We saw significant infection in double vaccinated folks even in Delta, but it largely prevented people from getting really sick.  We don’t have enough data to see if vaccination is preventing breakthrough infections or stopping people from catching severe disease. It will take 3-4 weeks to get some sense. All the news around this being ‘mild’ is anecdotal only. Note: even in earlier variants most of the people who were infected got mild symptoms only
04/12/21, 16:39 - Baava: 5/n. Early SA data shows, even hospitalizations are  picking up now. More worrisome is that more kids are being admitted to hospital compared to previous waves. Note: none of the kids are vaccinated..But majority of them had the natural infection in earlier waves.
04/12/21, 16:39 - Baava: <Media omitted>
04/12/21, 16:39 - Baava: 6/n.  Given that the epi curves are so steep, it is only a matter of time that Omicron will dominate other variants across the world. Even assuming it offers some protection to severe disease (best case scenario) for fully vaccinated people, note India has 45 Cr people below <18Y who haven’t been vaccinated and a significant amount of adults who haven’t taken 2nds dose and not so trivial amount of people who haven’t taken 1st dose also. Even if this affects a small % of ppl (best case scenario) given our huge population, we are looking at extremely large number of people who can get impacted and clog the healthcare system (based on epi curves, this might be actually much worse than the May delta wave )
04/12/21, 16:39 - Baava: 7/7 
a.	This is a disease spread by small aerosols and not large droplets. Think aerosols as cigarette smoke which lingers on in close indoor settings even after the smoker has left the room. we get infected by breathing infected air (aerosols) exhaled by SOME (not all) the infected ..mainly in close proximity, and in shared room air.  Avoid indoor room activity as much as possible. If cant avoid, wear high quality masks (N95, FFP2/3 etc) for the entire duration you are within enclosed space. The 6 ft rule was meant for large droplet transmission which is not applicable for Covid-19. Don’t worry about this being spread by surfaces. Unless you are in a healthcare setting, this wont matter. I stopped washing apples with soap water long back. Now I don’t even wash my hands before I eat  (which was my pre-pandemic behavior)
04/12/21, 16:39 - Baava: <Media omitted>
04/12/21, 16:40 - Baava: 8/8
b.	Try to move unavoidable activities to open air settings. This drastically reduces risk of infection. 
c.	Most N95 masks we get in India are not actually N95. You can check the approved list in https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html
AFAIK only 3M, Venus and Honeywell are the only N95 masks we can get in India. N95 masks always have headloop and not earloop. More than the mask, what matters is how it fits. Ensure complete fitment, especially over nose
d.	There is no point in panicking.  Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.  If you become eligible for a booster shot, take it

29/12/21, 21:58 - Baava: Time to give update on Omicron. Both good and the bad..
29/12/21, 21:58 - Baava: 1.	It all started in SA.  True to its nature, the cases exploded dramatically with exponential curve finally peaking 
• Cases peaked at 117% of Delta peak, now down to 66% of Delta peak
 • Hospitalisations at 60% of Delta peak 
• Deaths at 16% of Delta peak (This will go up a bit in next 2 weeks)
29/12/21, 21:58 - Baava: <Media omitted>
29/12/21, 21:58 - Baava: 2.	The good news part: It appears that Omicron appears  lesser virulent not just due to vaccination/prior infection, but all 4 independent studies done on animals show lower replication in lung tissue. Note: this means that it is “milder” but doesn’t mean everybody will get the mild version. Immunocompromised, old and few unlucky ppl will still get very sick and die
29/12/21, 21:59 - Baava: 3.	The bad news part: The case count will be dramatically high. In UK, France, USA, Denmark, the case counts are much higher than their delta waves (compared to SA).
29/12/21, 21:59 - Baava: <Media omitted>
29/12/21, 21:59 - Baava: 4.	The hosptilization data from UK is seeing lower % (of infected) ending in ICU/ventilator compared to delta waves. But due to sheer transimissibility, lower % doesn’t mean it wont clog healthcare. For eg.  If 60% less ppl are hospitalized compared delta..it shd mean good news rt? Not really.  UK daily case count rate now is 3 times its delta peak value. And they are very well vaccinated , many with boosters too(UK will reach omicron peak soon)..say delta peak was 10,000/day…and say 500 ppl needed hospitalization/day during delta peak. Say 60% less ppl require hospitalization now..But case count is 30,000/day at omicron peak. So 500*.6*3 = 900 ppl would require hospitzlization. So “mild” during high transimissibility will still burden hospitals, This is key for countries like India.
29/12/21, 21:59 - Baava: 5.	Coming to India: Now a lot of ppl think we are counting the omicron cases properly. We are not.  RTPCR/rapid tests will only say +ve or –ve. The positive swabs have to be sent to sequencing labs to check which variant it is (it will take 5-10 days to get that). India sends less than 1% +ve swabs to sequencing labs (UK sends 33%). In UK, France etc, where sequencing is done on significant number of random positive swabs, Omicron is close to 80-90% of cases.  In India also, it is likely beyond 50% already.
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: 6.	Why do I say that..Delhi and Mumbai cases are showing dramatic exponential cuves..Similar to SA, a few weeks ago. Delhi had 30 cases on 13-Dec and yday it was close to 500. And no, it is not due to increased testing. The test positivity rate has gone up from 0.1% to 0.9% (9X or or 900 %).
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: <Media omitted>
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: 7.	In all waves so far,  other states have lagged by 1-2 weeks. So we should see the same now. I think we will also see a very rapid growth with huge no of case counts.. The wave will be short lived as exponential curves go towards infinity, but we have limited no. of ppl.   Mathematically we are already seeing exponential curve for past 10 days in India..
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: <Media omitted>
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: 8.	As most ppl get mild symptoms, we likely have many cases not tested (our favorite excuse “due to weather change”). Also new research shows , vaccinated ppl don’t test +ve for first few days after showing symptoms either in RTPCR or RATs.
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: <Media omitted>
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: So even if we have mild cold or allergy symptoms, it is best not to mingle with ppl, especially old ones. Also get a few rapid test kits (costs 250) to see if you are infectious. In US and UK, public health officials have asked ppl to assume they have omicron if they have any cold symptoms so that they don’t spread it around
29/12/21, 22:00 - Baava: 9.	After the scary part what is the good news. Getting infected with Omicron provides immunity to Delta (which is more deadlier) – note: the reverse is not true. The way it is transmissible, virologists say that most of us will get infected with Omicron next year..Many of us will not even know when we get it. If there is no other variant of concern in the future, this highly transmissive, but relatively milder disease may signal an end game for this pandemic.
29/12/21, 22:01 - Baava: 10.	Finally, I have been modeling the epi waves (since delta wave) using the work I did in my Phd (forecasting using deep learning methods). Though my work was around stock market, it was basically time series data, and hence it is domain agnostic, if we have enough data.  I think (I will blame the model if it doesn’t turn out as predicted!), we will see a big surge in Jan -in case counts – peaking around later part of Jan. I just hope the hosptilaztion and morbidity/fatality count is much lower ( I also hope the model is wrong and that we don’t have a surge). even if there is a surge it cant stretch for a few months like delta and it will be over very quickly.  Get boosters when eligible!

04/01/22, 13:58 - Anitha Athe: Super arrange ment👌👌
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: Just wanted to give a quick update on Omicron:
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: 1.	As expected, this has taken off exponentially in India. In fact, India numbers are tracking what happened in SA.
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: 2.	I have been getting a lot of watsapp messages (I am sure many of you are also getting) which misrepresent the facts. Regarding it being mild or it being a nature’s vaccine – it is definitely appearing milder from clinical perspective in the sense that both in UK and SA, lower % of ppl are needing ICU and ventilators. But still a small % of people (both vacced and unvacced) are ending up requiring critical care. As the transmissibility is so high, the absolute count is what matters and we do not know if our hospitals can handle the surge
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: 3.	“If vaccines are not preventing infections, that means vaccines are useless”  
All the vaccines that are available for covid19 are of non-sterilizing type.  A sterilizing vaccine essentially means , the neutralizing antibodies produced from vaccination will stop the virus from replicating inside the body and stop an infection. Non-sterilizing vaccine cannot prevent infection, but prevents severe disease. Kids actually take a lot of non-sterilizing vaccines. Eg: Rotavrius vaccines given to kids to prevent diarrhea. Kids do get rotavirus related diarrhea after vaccination, but very few get severe disease or die. So the vaccine works. In fact, child mortality is significantly cut due to vaccines. Covid vaccines are also preventing significant deaths/hosptilizations at population scale. A very small % of vaccinated  and a big % of unvaxxed continue to get hospitalized/die. This is NOT in dispute. A good example from NYC
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: <Media omitted>
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: 4.	if boosters are need, that means vaccines are useless” – this is a pharma conspiracy etc
Actually most vaccines we take are multi-doses: Rotavirus – 3 doses within 6 months, HepB - – 3 doses within 6 months DTaP – 5 doses over 6 years,  multiple polio doses etc. These vaccines were tested over many years (some over decades also) before they found out optimal doses required.  .( None of us actually have asked our pediatricians why so many doses are required)  Corona vaccines have been created and  tested real time during a pandemic (a truly historical achievement). Based on what they learn from real world evidence, they are proposing boosters etc Now, I understand there might be commercial motive by pharma companies, pls note a lot of independent and world class virologists and immunologists support vaccines (and boosters). Also note Flu has a yearly booster shot which reduces the severity of disease.  SO multiple doses doesn’t mean they are ineffective
04/01/22, 19:58 - Baava: 5.	 this wave will cause havoc, but given the trajectory, mathematically, this should peak very soon..before this month end or even earlier.  I am not a big proponent of lockdowns, given its economic impact..but this is the time to be careful, if we are privileged enough (which most of us are). From a risk perspective, the risk of catching this has grown manifold in the last few days (btw I went to office daily for last 3 months , except for the last week, as the risk was lower .. but I have stopped going now).
04/01/22, 19:59 - Baava: 6.	And Happy New Year to you All!

 ನಾನು ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳ ಹಿಸ್ಟರಿ ಚರ್ಚಿಸಲು ಹೋಗುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೆ, ಒಂದು ವಿಚಾರವನ್ನು ಮಾತ್ರ ಇಲ್ಲಿ ದಾಖಲಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. 90ರ ದಶಕದ ಆರಂಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಉದಾರೀಕರಣದ ಜೊತೆಜೊತೆಗೆ ಖಾಸಗಿ ಎಂಜಿನಿಯರಿಂಗ್-ಮೆಡಿಕಲ್ ಕಾಲೇಜುಗಳ ಕ್ಯಾಪಿಟೇಶನ್ ಶುಲ್ಕದ ಭರಾಟೆ ತೀವ್ರಗೊಂಡಾಗ, ಕಾಮನ್ ಎಂಟ್ರಾನ್ಸ್ ಟೆಸ್ಟ್ ಎಂಬ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ನ್ಯಾಯದ ಸುಧಾರಣೆ ಹೊರಟದ್ದು ಉಡುಪಿ ಜಿಲ್ಲೆಯಿಂದಲೇ. ಅದರ ಹರಿಕಾರ, ಆಗ ಮುಖ್ಯಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆಗಿದ್ದ ವೀರಪ್ಪ ಮೋಯಿಲಿಯವರು. ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ತೀವ್ರ ಪ್ರತಿರೋಧ ಹೊರಟದ್ದೂ ದೇಶದ ಪ್ರಮುಖ ಶೈಕ್ಷಣಿಕ ನಗರವಾದ ಉಡುಪಿಯ ಮಣಿಪಾಲದಿಂದಲೇ! ಅದು ಹಳೇ ಕಥೆ. ಈಗ ಖಾಸಗಿಯವರು ಮತ್ತೆ ಮೇಲುಗೈ ಸಾಧಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ, ಅದೂ ಬಡ್ಡಿ ಸಮೇತ.

2016ರಲ್ಲಿ ದೇಶದ ಎಲ್ಲ ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಏಕೈಕ “ಪ್ರವೇಶ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ” ಎಂಬ ಹೆಗ್ಗಳಿಕೆಯೊಂದಿಗೆ ಆರಂಭಗೊಂಡ NEET ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಯ ಸ್ವರೂಪವನ್ನು ವಿವರವಾಗಿ ಗಮನಿಸಿದರೆ, ಅದು ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ಯಾವ ದಿಕ್ಕಿಗೆ ಕೊಂಡೊಯ್ಯುತ್ತಿದೆ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟವಾಗಿ ಗುರುತಿಸಬಹುದು. 720 ಅಂಕಗಳ, ಮೂರು ತಾಸಿನ ಈ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಯಲ್ಲಿ 360 ಅಂಕಗಳು ಬಯಾಲಜಿಗೆ ಮತ್ತು ತಲಾ 170 ಅಂಕಗಳು ಫಿಸಿಕ್ಸ್, ಕೆಮೆಸ್ಟ್ರಿಗೆ. ಇಲ್ಲಿ 180 ಬಹು ಉತ್ತರ ಆಯ್ಕೆಯ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗಳನ್ನು ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ 180 ನಿಮಿಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ತರಿಸಬೇಕಿರುತ್ತದೆ. ತಪ್ಪು ಉತ್ತರಕ್ಕೆ ಮೈನಸ್ ಅಂಕ ಇರುತ್ತದೆ.
ಸರಿ ಇದಕ್ಕೆಲ್ಲ ಯಾರದೂ ತಕರಾರಿಲ್ಲ.

ಆದರೆ, ಕಳೆದ ಆರೇಳು ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಈ NEET ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ವರ್ಷದಿಂದ ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೆ ಎಷ್ಟು ಬಿಗಿಗೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಾ ಬಂದಿದೆ ಎಂದರೆ ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಪ್ರವೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗೆ ಆಸಕ್ತಿ ಇದೆಯೇ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ಪರೀಕ್ಷಿಸಿ ಖಚಿತಪಡಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಆಗುವ ಬದಲು ಇದು ವಿಜ್ಞಾನದ ಯಾವ್ಯಾವುದೋ ಆಧುನಿಕ ಶಾಖೆಗಳ ಪರಿಣತಿಯನ್ನು ನಿಕಷಕ್ಕೊಡ್ಡುವ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಆಗಿ ಮಾರ್ಪಟ್ಟಿದೆ. 60 ಸೆಕುಂಡಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ತರಿಸಬೇಕಿರುವ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗೆ ಒಂದಿಡೀ ಪುಟ ಲೆಕ್ಕಾಚಾರ ಬೇಕಿರುವ, ವಿಷಯದ ಮೇಲೆ ಉನ್ನತ ಪರಿಣತಿ ಅಗತ್ಯವಿರುವ ಹಾಗೂ ಅದ್ಭುತ “ಬಾಯಿಪಾಠ” ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯ ಅಗತ್ಯ ಇರುವಾಗ ಬಡಪಾಯಿ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ ಏನು ಮಾಡಬೇಕು?

ಸಹಜವಾಗಿಯೇ, ದೇಶದಾದ್ಯಂತ ಈ ರೀತಿಯ ಪರಿಣತಿ ಒದಗಿಸುವುದಕ್ಕೆಂದೇ ಮೀಸಲಾಗಿರುವ “ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಸೆಂಟರ್” ದಂಧೆ ತಲೆ ಎತ್ತಿದೆ. ಈ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಸೆಂಟರ್‌ಗಳ ರಾಜಧಾನಿ, ಸ್ವತಃ ಭಾರತದ ಸಂಸತ್ತಿನ ಸ್ಪೀಕರ್ ಅವರು ಪ್ರತಿನಿಧಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವ ರಾಜಸ್ಥಾನದ “ಕೋಟಾ”. ALLEN, AAKASH, BAIJUS ಎಂಬಿತ್ಯಾದಿ ಹೆಸರುಗಳ, ಪುಟಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಪತ್ರಿಕಾ ಜಾಹೀರಾತುಗಳನ್ನು ನೀಡುತ್ತಿರುವ ಈ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಕೇಂದ್ರಗಳು ಇಂದು ದೇಶದಾದ್ಯಂತ ಅಂಗಡಿ ತೆರೆದು ಕುಳಿತಿವೆ. ವಾರ್ಷಿಕ ಒಂದರಿಂದ ಎರಡು ಲಕ್ಷ ರೂಪಾಯಿಗಳ ಶುಲ್ಕವನ್ನಿವು ವಿಧಿಸುತ್ತವೆ. ದೇಶದ ಹಲವೆಡೆ ಖಾಸಗಿ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳು ಈ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಪರಿಣತರ ಜೊತೆ ಹೊಂದಾಣಿಕೆ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು, ಇಂಟೆಗ್ರೇಟೆಡ್ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನೂ (ಅಂದರೆ ಪಿಯು ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದ ಜೊತೆಗೇ ನೀಟ್ ತರಬೇತಿ) ಆರಂಭಿಸಿವೆ. ಈ 24x7 ದರ್ಜೆಯ ತರಬೇತಿ ಉಂಟುಮಾಡುವ ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಒತ್ತಡದ್ದು ಇನ್ನೊಂದೇ ಕಥೆ. ಈ ಎಲ್ಲ ಒತ್ತಡಗಳನ್ನು ನಿಭಾಯಿಸಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗದವರು ಪಿಯು ಮುಗಿದ ತಕ್ಷಣ ಒಂದೋ ಎರಡೋ ವರ್ಷ “ಡ್ರಾಪ್ ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡು” (ಅಂದರೆ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಸ್ಥಗಿತಗೊಳಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು) ಈ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಪಡೆದು ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಬರೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಹೀಗೆ ಕಲಿತು 720ರಲ್ಲಿ 720 ಅಂಕ ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡ ಹೀರೋಗಳು ತಮ್ಮ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಸೆಂಟರಿನ ಲೋಗೋ ಇರುವ ಅಂಗಿ ಧರಿಸಿ ಬಿಲ್ ಬೋರ್ಡ್ ಏರಿದ್ದಾರೆ! ಪ್ರಯತ್ನಗಳ ಬಳಿಕವೂ ಯಶಸ್ಸು ಕಾಣದೆ ಹತಾಶರಾದವರು ಜೀವಕಳೆದುಕೊಂಡು “ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ ಆತ್ಮಹತ್ಯೆ” ಎಂಬ ಸಿಂಗಲ್ ಕಾಲಂ ಸುದ್ದಿ ಆದದ್ದೂ ಇದೆ.

ನನ್ನದೊಂದು ನೇರ ಸವಾಲಿದೆ: ಮುಂದಿನ ವರ್ಷದ ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗೆ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ಎಲ್ಲ ಪಿಯು ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರೂ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಬರೆಯಲಿ. ಅವರಲ್ಲಿ 10%ಮಂದಿಗೆ 720ರಲ್ಲಿ 350ಕ್ಕಿಂತ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಅಂಕ ಸಿಕ್ಕಿದರೆ ಮತ್ತೆ ಹೇಳಿ.

ಇಂತಹದೊಂದು “ಕಠಿಣಾತಿಕಠಿಣ” ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಯನ್ನು ಮೆಡಿಕಲ್ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಪ್ರವೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಇರಿಸಿರುವುದಕ್ಕೆ ಏಕೈಕ ಕಾರಣ- “ಎಲಿಮಿನೇಷನ್”. 

ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಎಂಬುದು ಕೇವಲ ಬುದ್ಧಿಮತ್ತೆ ಆಧರಿತ ಪರಿಣತಿ ಅಲ್ಲ. ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಕರ ಕೌಶಲ, ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಕ್ಷಮತೆ, ಕ್ಷಿಪ್ರ ನಿರ್ಧಾರದ ಕೌಶಲ, ವೃತ್ತಿಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಆಸಕ್ತಿ, ರೋಗಿಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಕಾಳಜಿ… ಹೀಗೆ ನೂರಾರು ಅಂಶಗಳು ಒಳಗೊಂಡಿರಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇದಾವುದನ್ನೂ ಪ್ರವೇಶ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಯ ವೇಳೆ ಪರಿಗಣಿಸದೇ, ಕೇವಲ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಸೆಂಟರುಗಳು ಕಟ್ಟಿಕೊಟ್ಟ “ಬೌದ್ಧಿಕ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯ” ಆಧರಿಸಿದ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ನಡೆಸಿದಾಗ, ನಿಜಕ್ಕೂ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತ ಬೆರಳೆಣಿಕೆಯ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಬಿಟ್ಟರೆ, ಉಳಿದವರೆಲ್ಲ ಎಲಿಮಿನೇಟ್ ಆಗಿಬಿಡುತ್ತಾರೆ. ನಗರಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಹಳ್ಳಿಗಳ ಪ್ರತಿಭೆಗಳ ನಡುವೆ ಅವಕಾಶದ ಕಂದರ ಹುಟ್ಟುವುದೂ ಇಲ್ಲೇ.

ಮತ್ತೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯೂ ಹೇಗೆ “360 ಡಿಗ್ರಿ ಫ್ಲೆಕ್ಸಿಬಲ್” ಎಂದರೆ, ಮೆಡಿಕಲ್ ಆಗದಿದ್ದರೆ ಡೆಂಟಲ್, ಡೆಂಟಲ್ ಸಿಗದಿದ್ದರೆ ಎಂಜಿನಿಯರಿಂಗ್, ಅದೂ ಸಿಗದಿದ್ದರೆ ಅಗ್ರಿಕಲ್ಚರ್, ಅದೂ ಆಗದಿದ್ದರೆ ಲಾ… ಹೀಗೆ!
 
ಮಕ್ಕಳ ಆಸಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಎಳವೆಯಲ್ಲೇ ಗುರುತಿಸಿ ಬೆಳೆಸುವ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯೊಂದನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸುವುದಕ್ಕೆ ನಮಗೆ ಇಂದಿಗೂ ಸಾಧ್ಯ ಆಗಿಲ್ಲ.

“ಮೆರಿಟ್” ಸೀಟು ಸೀಮಿತ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯದಿರುವಾಗ, ಹೆತ್ತವರಲ್ಲಿ ಲಕ್ಷಗಟ್ಟಲೆ ಫೀಸು ಕಟ್ಟುವ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯ ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ, ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಮತ್ತೆ ಮತ್ತೆ “ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್” ಪಡೆದು ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮರಳಿ ಯತ್ನವ ಮಾಡುವುದು ಒಂದು ವಿನ್ಯಾಸವಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಇದು ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಒಂದು “ಬಾಟಲ್ ನೆಕ್” ಸೃಷ್ಟಿ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಎರಡು-ಮೂರು ವರ್ಷ “ನೀಟ್ ಬರೆಯುವ ತರಬೇತಿ” ಪಡೆದ ಸಾಧಾರಣ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಯ ಪರಿಣತಿಯ ಎದುರು ಆ ವರ್ಷವಷ್ಟೇ ಪಿಯು ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಮುಗಿಸಿರುವ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಯ ಕೌಶಲ ಸೋಲುತ್ತದೆ. ಇಂತಹವರ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ವರ್ಷದಿಂದ ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ. ನೀವು ಕಳೆದ ಐದಾರು ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಬರೆದವರ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯಲ್ಲಾಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಸತತ ಏರಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಗಮನಿಸಿದರೆ ಇದು ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. 
ಕಳೆದೆರಡು ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊವಿಡ್ ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಸುಸೂತ್ರ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವೂ ಸಿಗದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳದಂತೂ ಅಸಹನೀಯ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ. ಈ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕಾರಣಗಳಿಂದಾಗಿ ನೀಟ್ ಹೆಸರಲ್ಲಿ ಆತ್ಮಹತ್ಯೆ, ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು ಒಂದೇ ಸಮನೆ ಏರಿಕೆ ಕಾಣುತ್ತಿವೆ.

ಒಟ್ಟಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಕಂತಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನನಗೆ ಹೇಳಬೇಕಾಗಿರುವುದು ಇಷ್ಟು:

೧. ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಬರೆಯಬೇಕಿದ್ದರೆ, ಖಾಸಗಿ ಕೋಚಿಂಗ್ ಸೆಂಟರ್ ಲಾಬಿಗೆ ಕಾಸು ಚೆಲ್ಲಬೇಕು.
೨. ನೀಟ್ ಎಂಬುದು ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣಕ್ಕೆ ಅರ್ಹನೋ ಎಂಬ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ಅಲ್ಲ, ಬದಲಾಗಿ ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದಷ್ಟು ಮಂದಿ ಮಧ್ಯಮವರ್ಗದವರನ್ನು ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದಿಂದ “ಎಲಿಮಿನೇಟ್” ಮಾಡುವ ಆಟ.
೩. ಮೇಲ್ತುದಿಯ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತರು, ಕೆಳತುದಿಯ ಕಾಸಿದ್ದವರು ಹೇಗೋ ನೀಟ್ ಏಣಿಯೇರಿ ಮೆಡಿಕಲ್ ಸ್ಕೂಲ್ ತಲುಪುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಆದರೆ ನಡುವಿನ ವಿಶಾಲವಾದ ಮಧ್ಯಮವರ್ಗದವರು ತಮ್ಮ ಪ್ರತಿಭೆ, ಮೀಸಲಾತಿಗಳ ಹೊರತಾಗಿಯೂ ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಪಡೆಯಲು ಏದುಸಿರು ಬಿಡಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಇದು ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ನೀಟ್ ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಕೊಡುಗೆ.
೪. ಈ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕಾರಣಗಳಿಗಾಗಿ ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆ ರದ್ದಾಗಬೇಕು. ಅರ್ಹತೆ, ಆಸಕ್ತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಗುರುತಿಸಿ, ಅರ್ಹರನ್ನು ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಕೇಂದ್ರಗಳಿಗೆ ತಲುಪಿಸಲು ಹೊಸ ಮಾದರಿಯೊಂದು ರೂಪುಗೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು.

03/03/22, 13:32 - Krishna uncle: ಇದನ್ನು ಎಲ್ಲರೂ ಓದಬೇಕು.
03/03/22, 14:35 - Baava: One critical issue is NEET is allowing North Indians to take seats from the Southern States. While the South has historically invested in education and built up capacity (while North built cow schools), NEET has allowed North Indians to take our seats.
03/03/22, 14:35 - Baava: <Media omitted>
03/03/22, 14:36 - Baava: Of the ~83,000 MBBS seats, 40% are in the 5 southern states, and of 16 lakh applicants 30% are from these states. While only 20% of India's population resides in these 5 states.
03/03/22, 14:36 - Baava: Of these 83,275 seats – 43,435 (52%) seats are in 289 Govt colleges.

In most large states majority of seats are in private colleges. Except Gujarat, Rajasthan, MP, Bengal, Bihar, Delhi etc.

9 states have only govt seats, no private colleges exist here.
03/03/22, 14:40 - Baava: Except TN, nobody opposed NEET. Anything done based on "One India" ideology penalizes the prosperous South at the expense of North. GST implementation made this worse. The South is subsidizing a misgoverned and inefficient North.  The worst part is anyone can rule India by not winning a single seat from the South. Winning 4-5 populous states in the North is enough. The Southern people who support "nationalist" parties are basically working against their own self interest in the name of "One India" ideology
03/03/22, 14:43 - Baava: NEET and GST are actually working against us. We cannot even raise local taxes now due to GST. and we do t get back our share of money from the centerm (we get 60 paise for 1 INR contribution but UP gets close to 2 INR for 1 INR contribution). They ensure we waste our time and energy in useless controversies like Hijab etc. The South should be on streets fighting for abolition of NEET and GST
03/03/22, 14:45 - Baava: This is not just an academic debate. It directly affects our kids and their descendants
03/03/22, 18:28 - Puneeth: Tamil Nadu is probably the only state that makes some noise on these issues. The rest of the South Indian states talk, but is never loud enough to make any difference at the central. I’m pretty sure this will never change

29/03/22, 18:25 - Krishna uncle: 💐🙏🌞 *SUPRABHAT*🌞🙏💐

*14 short stories worth reading, feeling and forwarding to all those dear to you*..
 
*1. Fall and Rise*
 
Today, when I slipped on the wet tile floor a boy in a wheelchair caught me before I slammed my head on the ground.  He said, “Believe it or not, that’s almost exactly how I injured my back 3 years ago .
 
*2. A father's advice*
 
Today, my father told me, “Just go for it and give it a try!  You don’t have to be a professional to build a successful product.  Amateurs started Google and Apple.  Professionals built the Titanic
 
*3. The power of uniqueness.*
 
Today, I asked my mentor – a very successful business man in his 70’s – what his top 3 tips are for success.  He smiled and said, *“Read something no one else is reading, think something no one else is thinking, and do something no one else is doing*.
 
*4. Looking Back*
 
Today, I interviewed my grandmother for part of a research paper I’m working on for my Psychology class.  When I asked her to define success in her own words, she said, “Success is when you look back at your life and the memories make you smile.
 
*5. Try and U shall know*
 
I am blind by birth. When I was 8 years old, I wanted to play baseball. I asked my father- "Dad, can I play baseball?" He said "You'll never know until you try." When I was a teenager, I asked him, - "Dad Can I become a surgeon?". He replied "Son, you'll never know until you try." Today I am a Surgeon, just because I tried!
 
*6. GOODNESS & GRATITUDE*
 
Today, after a 72 hour shift at the fire station, a woman ran up to me at the grocery store and gave me a hug.  When I tensed up, she realized I didn’t recognize her.  She let go with tears of joy in her eyes and the most sincere smile and said, *“On 9-11-2001, you carried me out of the World Trade Center.”*
 
*7. LOVE CONQUERS PAIN*
 
Today, after I watched my dog get run over by a car, I sat on the side of the road holding him and crying.  And just before he died, he licked the tears off my face.
 
*8. A DOOR CLOSES TO OPEN ANOTHER*
 
Today at 7AM, I woke up feeling ill, but decided I needed the money, so I went into work. At 3PM I got laid off. On my drive home I got a flat tire. When I went into the trunk for the spare, it was flat too. A man in a BMW pulled over, gave me a ride, we chatted, and then he offered me a job.  I start tomorrow.
 
*9. LOOKING BACK*
 
Today, as my father, three brothers, and two sisters stood around my mother’s hospital bed, my mother uttered her last coherent words before she died. She simply said, *“I feel so loved right now. We should have gotten together like this more often.”*
 
*10. AFFECTION*
 
Today, I kissed my dad on the forehead as he passed away in a small hospital bed.  About 5 seconds after he passed, I realized it was the first time I had given him a kiss since I was a little boy.
 
*11. INNOCENCE*
 
Today, in the cutest voice, my 8-year-old daughter asked me to start recycling. I chuckled and asked, “Why?” She replied, “So you can help me save the planet.”  I chuckled again and asked, “And why do you want to save the planet?" “Because that’s where I keep all my stuff,” she said
 
*12. JOY*
 
Today, when I witnessed a 27-year-old breast cancer patient laughing hysterically at her 2-year-old daughter’s antics, I suddenly realized that I need to stop complaining about my life and start celebrating it again.
 
*13. KINDNESS*
 
Today, a boy in a wheelchair saw me desperately struggling on crutches with my broken leg and offered to carry my backpack and books for me.  He helped me all the way across campus to my class and as he was leaving he said, *“I hope you feel better soon.”*
 
*14. SHARING*
 
Today, I was traveling in Kenya and I met a refugee from Zimbabwe.  He said he hadn’t eaten anything in over 3 days and looked extremely skinny and unhealthy.  Then my friend offered him the rest of the sandwich he was eating.  The first thing the man said was, “ *We can share it*”
 
😃 *CHEERS TO LIFE*😃

💐Namaskaar n Good Morning💐
👍Make it a Wonderful Day filled with Love, Joy n Happiness👍
🙏May God Bless Us All 🙏
😃Be Happy & Keep Smiling😃

13/04/22, 08:04 - Kampa Aunt: *What is SARCOPENIA*

 Sarcopenia. is the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength as a result of ageing.  It is a terrible condition.

Let’s explore sarcopenia !

Title: "Slowly Use Your Functional Muscles"

1. To develop a habit of being able to stand ... just don’t sit!  ... and don’t lie down if you can sit!

2. After the age of 50~60, it is not possible to lose weight, especially if you do not exercise and rely on eating less to lose weight!  
Because if all the muscles are lost, it can be  very dangerous!

3. Does running, cycling or climbing hurt the knee?
If you have never exercised before you can only go running, biking, or climbing in your mind as it will hurt your knees a lot!  
But if you have enough muscle strength and slowly develop the habit of running, cycling, and climbing, it can be a good exercise and not hurt your knees!  Whether you hurt your knees or not depends on your muscle strength!

4. If an elderly person is sick and hospitalized, don't ask him to rest more ... or lie down and relax and not get out of bed!
Lying down for a week loses at least 5% of muscle mass !  
And the old man can't get his muscles back !

5. Don't think that you are filial by not letting the elders do any housework, and scold the maid if they do it ! 
Usually, many elderly people who hire helpers lose muscle faster !

6. Don't just do a single activity every day when you go to the park. 
Dont just shake your hands when you can also shake your legs. You must also pull the horizontal bar or move every sports equipment! 
Because as long as a person moves, then all the muscles of whole body will be involved!  
Many elderly people even have difficulty swallowing because of insufficient exercise!  
In the end, they could not even cough up a mouthful of sputum and die because of this!

7. Sarcopenia is more terrifying than osteoporosis ! 
With osteoporosis you just need to be careful not to fall, whereas sarcopenia not only affects the quality of life but also causes high blood sugar due to insufficient muscle mass!

8. The fastest loss of sarcopenia is in the muscle of the legs!
Because when a person sits or lie down, the legs are not moving and the muscle strength of the legs are affected ... this is particularly important !  
Don't become black feet !  

So squat at least 20 to 30 times a day. 
Squat is not squatting down but like sitting on the toilet seat ... you can use a chair and stand up when your butt touches the seat!

You MUST pay attention to sarcopenia!

Go up & down stairs ... running, cycling and climbing are all great exercises and can increase muscle mass!

For a better quality of life for everyone in old age ... 

Move... don't waste your muscle!!

*Aging   starts   from  the  feet  upwards !*
       
KEEP  YOUR   LEGS  ACTIVE  &  STRONG  !!

▪️As  we   put   on  years  &  keep   getting   old   on  a  daily  basis ,   our  feet  must   always   remain active & strong.
As  we  are constantly   ageing / get aged,  we  should not  be  afraid  of  our  hair  turning   grey (or) skin  sagging ( or) wrinkles on face.

▪️Among  the  signs  of *longevity*, long fit life as summarized  by the  popular US Magazine  " Prevention ", strong  leg   muscles  are listed  on  the   top,  as  *the  most  important & essential  one.* 
Please walk daily.

▪️If   you  don’t move your  legs for just two  weeks,  your real leg  strength  will  decrease  by 10  years. 
*Just walk*

▪️A  study  from  the University of Copenhagen in  Denmark  found  that both old & young, during  the  two   weeks  of  *inactivity*,  the  legs  muscle  strength can *weaken by a  third* which is equivalent  to   20-30  years  of  ageing !! 
*So just walk*

▪️As  our  leg  muscles weaken, it  will  take a long  time  to  recover, even if  we  do rehabilitation  & exercises,  later. 
WALK. 

▪️Therefore, *regular exercise like walking, is very important*.

▪️The  whole   body weight/ load  remains  and  rest  on  the  legs.

▪️The *feet  are a  kind  of pillars*, bearing  the entire weight  of  the  human  body. 
*Walk everyday.*

▪️Interestingly,  50%  of a  person's  bones & 50%  of  the   muscles, are  in  the  two  legs. 
*Do walk*

▪️The  largest &  strongest  joints & bones  of  the   human body   are  also  in  the  legs. 
*10K steps / day*

▪️Strong   bones, strong  muscles  and flexible   joints   form  the *Iron  Triangle*   that  carries  the  most important   load   i.e.  *the  human  body."*

▪️70%  of  human activity and burning  of energy in  one's  life  is done  by  the  two  feet.

▪️Do  you  know  this ? When a  person  is  young,   his/ her  *thighs have  enough  strength , to lift  a  small car of  800 kg !*

▪️The *foot  is  the center of  body locomotion*.

▪️Both  the   legs together  have  50%   of the   nerves    of   the  human  body,  50%   of  the   blood  vessels  and  50%  of   the   blood   is flowing  through   them.

▪️ It  is  the  largest  circulatory  network  that connects  the   body. 
*So walk daily.*

▪️Only *when  the feet are  healthy then  the convention current  of blood  flows ,  smoothly,   so  people who  have  strong  leg muscles  will  definitely have  a strong  heart.* Walk. 

▪️Aging  starts  from  the  feet  upwards

▪️As  a   person  gets older, the  accuracy & speed  of  transmission  of instructions   between the  brain and   the  legs decreases, unlike  when a  person  is  young. *Please walk*

▪️In   addition,   the   so-called   Bone  Fertilizer Calcium will  sooner  or later  be  lost  with  the passage  of  time,  making  the   elderly  more  prone  to   bone fractures. *WALK.*

▪️Bone  fractures  in  the  elderly   can  easily  trigger  a  series   of complications, especially  fatal  diseases   such  as   brain   thrombosis.

▪️Do  you   know   that 15% of elderly  patients   generally, will  die  max. within  a  year  of   a  thigh-bone   fracture !! *Walk daily without fail*

▪️ *Exercising  the legs,   is   never  too  late, even  after   the  age  of 60  years.*

▪️Although   our   feet/legs  will   gradually   age with    time,  exercising  our  feet/ legs  is  a  life-long  task.  
*Walk 10,000 steps*

▪️Only  by regular strengthening   the  legs, one   can   prevent   or reduce  further  aging. *Walk 365 days*

▪️ Please  walk  for at  least 30-40  minutes   daily   to  ensure   that   your   legs  receive   sufficient   exercise and  to  ensure  that  your  leg  muscles remain healthy.

*You  should   share  this  important  information  with  all  your  40+years"  friends & family  members, as everyone  is  aging  on  a  daily  basis*.*

04/06/22, 13:43 - Geethathe: Loved this poem💖

Poet unknown:

Sometimes,
I feel I want to go back in time... 

Not to change things, but to feel a couple of things twice..

Sometimes,
I wish I was a Baby for a while... 

Not to be walked in the pram but to see my Mother's smile

Some times,
I wish I could go back to school... 

Not to become a child but to spend  more time with those friends, I never met after school..

Sometimes,
I wish I could be back in college... 

Not to be a rebel but to really understand what I studied

Sometimes, 
I wish I was a fresher at my work... 

Not to do less work but to recall the joy of the first pay cheque

Sometimes, 
I wish I could marry again all over... 

Not to change the partner but to 'feel' the ceremony better

Sometimes, 
I wish my kids were younger.... 

Not because they grew fast but to play with them a bit more

Sometimes, 
I feel I still had some more time to live... 

Not to have a longer life but to know what I could give to others

Since the times that are gone can never come back, let's enjoy the moments as we live them from now on, to the fullest..

Let's Celebrate our Life - Every Moment, Every Day!!🎉🎊🎈💃🏿
